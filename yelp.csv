0,Washington,2018-07-17,6kTdd4Ce_gsj7HFbY_JjtQ,5, DC,"WOW. Everything about this restaurant was AMAZING. 100% recommend. Service: Service was outstanding! Our server answered all of our questions, was extremely patient and knowledgable. Additionally, we were here for our anniversary and they printed a menu with ""Happy Anniversary"" on it, which I thought was a very cute!Food: Everything from the appetizers to the desserts were so rich, flavorful, and delicious. One thing to note is the entrees do not come with sides, so make sure you order some sides in addition to  your main course. Drinks: They have a great selection of beers, cocktails, and wine. I had the ""soo good"" cocktail and it was the perfect mix of tasty + strong. Atmosphere: Really cool open kitchen atmosphere. The restaurant feels very modern, airy, and open.This is an amazing restaurant - great food, great service, great atmosphere! 100% TRY.",Molly M.
1,Washington,2018-07-24,KWBop4Gu_2TNlmOjmKw0HA,2, DC,"Birthday dinner disappointment...starting off with where we were seated. I was hoping to get a table closer by the open kitchen and enclosed in the glass walls rather than away from the center of action. Secondly, we were never given a complimentary dessert from their menu which seems to be a point made by other fellow Yelpers...Also! Menu prices were increased and not reflective of the prices on their online menu! When I asked our waitress why the prices I checked yesterday (I scoured their website and did a bit of research before coming) were significantly higher than what was on the menu, her response was that this was the current price...and that was it? Also when I asked the waitress about whether we could order our food ""family style"" she didn't really help us out, I felt like I was asking for her guidance given it was a large group but instead left feeling slightly abandoned. Also...they forced us to tip 20%?? I don't mind at all giving credit where credit is due (in fact I encourage it) but I thought maybe it would have been better had we been given the choice of how much to tip. While my friends and I were finishing up our conversations they told us we had to leave around 8:30pm because another party was coming. I understand that they have to book their tables and establish finite times for parties but they could have executed this a bit better given we were finishing up and all spent + $75 per person on the meal. Moving onto the food...I'll be fair I had just dined at another Michelin establishment not too long ago, so alright maybe my taste buds were a bit spoiled, but given this place also has a Michelin Star I didn't understand the hype? We ordered the Wood Oven-Roasted Bone Marrow (good), Braised Beef Rib (soft meat, but somewhat basic flavorings), Moulder Duck Breast, (Rhubarb-Ginger Marmalade sauce was good, but duck was slightly chewy), Wood Oven-Roasted Whole Fish (good but a little plain inside), Rockfish (wasn't on menu, pretty good), Hand-Cut BDT fries (good, aioli is on point!), Cornbread (good but for $13 not the best I've had), and last but not least the Roasted Wild Mushrooms (a little too salty, not much complexity in flavor).Favorite part of experience was the pretty and open/airy atmosphere (beautiful, clean, glass walls and hardwood) but the average/""good but not great"" service + likewise ""good but not great"" tasting food left more to be desired. Maybe I came in expecting too much but for the $$$ you pay and the occasion it was, I wanted more for my group and we didn't get that. Overall TLDR; I left unsatisfied with the ""value"" that my party of 9 received. It was like minor disappointment after disappointment...for a birthday it just didn't feel as special like I've seen from other Yelp reviews. Not sure I'd recommend in terms of Michelin dining because when I think Michelin I am thinking it should be memorable, in a good way, especially for special occasions, so overall I left feeling sorely disappointed. My experience did not live up to the 4/5 Star review experiences others had, and given the hefty price tag my stomach was left wondering what went wrong.",Michelle W.
2,Northwest Washington,2018-07-24,laRraRcFSpMkL6a-i3vnJA,4, Washingto,"Blue Duck Tavern was a place that I wanted to try ever since I moved to DC.  My wife and I went here for an anniversary and we were not disappointed.  The bone marrow appetizer wasn't for us but everything else was of the highest quality.  The wait staff was also incredible.  When we experimented by ordering a unique dessert that was a little too tart for our liking, the wait staff immediately brought us another dessert without being asked and without charging us.  That attention to detail and above and beyond customer service left us highly impressed with our experience.  Highly recommend this place for a special occasion.",R D.
3,Arlington,2018-07-04,L3SdS-vlVM6V-w01csE6bg,4, VA,"A very long overdue review -My boyfriend and I first tried Blue Duck Tavern back in August 2015 (before they got their Michelin star!) and we loved our experience then, and to this day, we are still huge fans.It seems that the menu changes seasonally which allows the restaurant to showcase a variety of local ingredients. What really makes BDT stand out from other dining restaurants is really the attention to detail(s). Two items that we loved, but is sadly not on the current menu, were the dry aged steak for 2 - but if it does come back, I highly recommend this - and the foie gras creme brûlée*. I added the asterisk to the creme brûlée because though delicious, it is incredibly rich and too much for two to share - I recommend this for larger groups. Some of the other items on the dinner menu that we love include the wood oven-roasted bone marrow, pan-seared scallops, and moulard duck breast. The seasoning and pairings seem to change slightly with the poultry or shellfish, but the seared scallops in uni emulsion topped with caviar, black garlic chips, and beet coins (January 2018) is still one of my favorite dishes to date.The brunch menu is actually what I love most about BDT. This may be my favorite brunch place in the entire city (pretty bold for a brunch fanatic like myself). I frequently bring guests here and it is always a hit. Again, the menu changes seasonally, but upon my latest trip (June 2018), here are a few of my favorites: Short Rib Hash (this seems to stay on the menu the handful of times I have done brunch here), Hot-Fried Chicken Biscuit, Lemon French Toast, and Pecan Sticky Buns (also seems to be a keeper season after season). Even my boyfriend, who is not typically a fan of nuts in his food, loved the Pecan Sticky Buns. BDT always has unique pairings of sweet and savory, and to me, that's part of the appeal to trying something new.Great food and great service. Highly recommend booking in advance, especially for a large party, but you won't be disappointed.",Vicky L.
4,New York,2018-06-22,7Zd8QrDDi4fkFqwanHfppQ,3, NY,"We came for Father's day brunch. The restaurant was very nice, spacious, and accommodating for my 8-month old. Service on that day was very slow, something that I wouldn't expect for a Michelin-star restaurant. We were very thirsty from the weather and water was left unfilled, one of the side dishes they completely forgot about, and a drink order was incorrect. The food had some standout dishes I found to be very good: the crab cake, was one of the more meatier interpretations I've ever had that I enjoyed; the coconut tapioca was beautifully presented and had nice flavor to replicate the carrot cake. Unfortunately the main brunch dishes we had - the hot chicken biscuit and the short rib hash, were pretty unmemorable. The hot chicken tasted like sweet/sour chicken you'd find at an Americanized Chinese Restaurant, a taste I was not expecting, with an egg that was cooked far too long. The short-rib hash was nothing special, the same version you can find at most brunch restaurants. I would try the dinner, as I'm sure that's what the accolades were based on. The brunch, I would pass for another alternative.",Lu H.
5,Hoboken,2018-07-11,zIBmBM2-9BujKpp2anb-eg,5, NJ,"My Husband and I go out to dinner several times a week like any other millennial couple ;-) We're from New York and suffice it to say we have a lot of options from the high-end seafood restaurant down to the hole-in-the-wall Ramen Bar. I would not quite call us food snobs so we'll settle on ""a particular pallet"" as the label. That said, this was without a doubt the best meal we've ever had. The entire experience was immaculate. The service was exquisite, our waiter was attentive, courteous, knowledgeable about the menu and was capable of making actual recommendations (not the ""this is my favorite"" or ""everything's good here"") along with a witty conversation that kept us laughing. The food was perfectly prepared and his descriptions were spot on. Though pricey, the experience is absolutely worth it for any special occasion. The next time we visit the city, dinner at this restaurant is an absolute must. While many people turn out to be revenge posters or the owe the manager a favor, this post is neither. If you are celebrating a special occasion and want a memorable evening, go to the Blue Duck Tavern.",Jerica B.
6,Washington,2018-07-17,B2LAbyCI2XWnxX9m0aj7CQ,5, DC,"We came here for brunch and are visiting again for dinner soon. I will update review then. But brunch... was so satisfying. We tried some savory items and some sweet, and are glad we did. The ambiance was relaxing, the service was impeccable, and our server made good recommendations, which we always appreciate. The bone marrow appetizer was so rich and flavorful, and the pancakes were not just everyday pancakes. They were special. The fried chicken biscuit also hit the spot. Coffee was great. No complaints. Can't wait to try dinner!",Stefanie B.
7,Alexandria,2018-07-08,NdAZFEGytqQhmTeVkuffJw,4, VA,"A terrific experience last night. Seated promptly and was fortunate enough to have Tibor as our waiter. He succinctly reviewed the menu, aptly explained (and allowed us to sample) wines that we were interested in and paced the courses perfectly. For appetizers, we selected the bone marrow (which was a first for me) and the seafood risotto). Both were excellent and the bone marrow was large enough to split among our party of four.For our entrees we went full spectrum. Filet Mignon, braised short ribs, pork chop and duck breast. Aka carte options included horseradish potato purée, Blue Duck Tavern (BDT) fries and roasted mushrooms. I don't think we had a bad bite amongst all of the aforementioned cuisine. The portions were perfect, obvious attention to detail in the presentation and flavor profiles. If I had to pick the winners, it would be the braised short ribs (surprisingly lean, so tender) with a perfect zing of balsamic reduction. Believe it or not, the BDT fries were exceptional. These things were beyond steak fries into a perfectly formed rectangles, lightly crunchy exterior with mashed potato-like interior. One could be split into two they come 6 to an order. Add in some wine and a cocktail and you'll be pushing the $150 mark before tip for two. But on a relaxed Saturday evening we were made to feel as though we were the only ones in the restaurant. A memorable experience!",Jason M.
8,Ann Arbor,2018-06-14,bl52lwF9fuKa1-3IwIpDuw,5, MI,"Visited a friend in DC and of course had to seek out some crab cakes. Stayed at the Westin, so Blue Duck Tavern was right across the street. Michelin star in 2017 and 2018 so we had to check it out. Stop in for a light lunch and it did not disappoint although service was slightly above meh. We ordered the two crab cake appetizer ($32), two salads (baby gem lettuce and the spring pea salad ($16 each)) and the duck leg confit ($26). Lets start with the crab cakes. Nice crust on the top of a beautifully light, moist cake. The crab was glistening. Its how a crab cake should be done. Not a dense ball of breadcrumbs. The cake was beautiful and garnished with lots of delicately cut chives. A top the cake was some smoked trout roe which give a nice little pop of salt n smoke. The dish could've used a little more of the lobster aioli, but thats basically the only ""complaint"" I can cone up with. The dish came with a very vibrant side salad with rainbow chard/stems, a crisp type of lettuce and thinly sliced radishes. It was nice to go back n forth between the freshness of the salad and the crab.The Baby gem salad was great. It was dressed with an excellently balanced cured egg dressing. Salty, tangy, kind of creamy but not to creamy!! Had some pickled onions and caramelized ramps. The hearts of romaine were very crisp. The salad was simple yet elegant. Could've used A few more ramps and onions but overall it was very nice. My wife ordered the spring pea salad which came with snap peas in the pod, some peas out of the pod along with pea shoots. The salad was served atop of a honey almond butter and some crispy pancetta. Very unique salad but really interesting flavor combination. Thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend. Never really had anything like it!The duck confit leg was fall off the bone...as duck confit should. The skin was crisp and the dish was visually stunning. The rhubarb marmalade added a nice note of sweetness and tang and the side roasted vegetables were delish. I picked up the bones and ate them with my hands until they were bare. Really really good. You know you are going to pay for a meal like this. So if you are going to eat there and then complain about the bill, go somewhere else. Lots of flavor and high quality chow! Definitely give it a go if you have the chance!",Eric N.
9,Arlington,2018-05-14,RVaauMM-f2vFUYpGlCYJ2Q,5, VA,"I've been wanting to try Blue Duck Tavern for the longest time and finally got around to visiting for my birthday this past weekend.Just a tip, MAKE RESERVATIONS EARLY. I made a reservation nearly a month in advance and most time slots were already taken. We managed to get an 8:15pm reservation on a Friday night. It was pretty easy to find and upon arriving, all the hostesses said happy birthday and were very friendly! We were seated promptly and our server, who was very professional and friendly, greeted us. He also knew it was my birthday and didn't forget throughout the whole meal.To start, my boyfriend got an old fashioned and I got the Carry Me Away cocktail. I thought it was going to be tart but it was absolutely delicious and refreshing. My boyfriend also really enjoyed his drink as well.For food, you're encouraged to get a couple different dishes as the portions are a bit smaller. You do get bread before your food so go easy so you leave some room! I made the mistake of eating too much bread. We got:Bone Marrow: this was my first time trying bone marrow and only because others were raving about it. It was surprisingly pretty good, a tad bit salty but the pretzel bits added a nice contrasting crunch. The texture bothered me a bit but that's not BDT's fault.Butcher's Cut: absolutely delicious. We got it medium rare and it was one of the few steaks that was actually cooked properly. My boyfriend is a huge steak fan and he loved it so it got his stamp of approval too!Duck Breast: by far, my favorite dish we had all night. It was cooked perfectly and practically melted in your mouth and fell off the bone. I wish I could eat this every day!BDT Fries & Corn Bread: both delicious! We didn't have much of these as we were stuffed from the other entrees but definitely suggest the fries!I was so stuffed by the end of the meal but had to get dessert. Our waiter suggested the Coconut Tapioca if we were looking for something on the lighter side (which we were after all that food)! The dessert came out with a candle and a ""happy birthday"" message written on the plate which was such a nice touch! The dessert itself was delicious, very light and not too filling. It had many components to it, like saffron, carrot cake and nuts.At the end of the meal, we were also given a bag of complimentary sugar cookies and a happy birthday menu signed with the date and birthday wishes from the BDT staff. The sugar cookies were some of the best I've ever had, perfectly soft and airy. Th signed menu was really nice, since the menus are seasonal so it gives you a little memory to take away.Overall, everything from the service to the food was divine. I'd highly recommend stopping by for a special occasion, you won't be disappointed!",Katie W.
10,Madison,2018-07-03,6nfMQfDO118s_VuwYQ2VgA,3, WI,"Totally disappointed. I come here because it is the Michelin star restaurant. As a Michelin the price is relatively low, but the food is below average. We ordered the bone marrow, which is just okay. Then we look forward to our main courses to make up the disappointment from the starter. The Halibut and the duck breast came after and they looked nice.The duck breast is tender and juicy, and I like the peachy flavor with a bit sweet and sour hint. This course, I'd say, above average. If you are already here and have to order something, order the duck please!The halibut! Overcooked and all you can taste is just something dry without any feeling on my taste buds.. I would say I can definitely cook better fish myself at home! Avoid this!Now I am wondering, how can BDT get the Michelin star?",Kristy W.
11,Washington,2018-05-03,om1FLCJudjUoMwmo8I4WNA,3, DC,"I'm not quite sure how this is a Michelin Star restaurant. The food was ""okay"" and the service was lacking.  It took our server about 15 minutes to approach our table.  The bread basket took even longer. He was inattentive and I had to keep looking around for him, hoping to make eye contact so he would do things like take our order, refill our waters, offer another cocktail, see if we are enjoying our food, etc.On to the food...Spring Pea Salad: This is a tasty starter, I'd recommend itBone Marrow: It was good, but it wasn't great. It sits on a bed of course salt crystals, which is great for presentation but not really practical.  I wish they had just seasoned the marrow. Pro-tip: Beuchert's Saloon has a delicious bone marrow.Duck Breast: The duck was my least favorite dish at Blue ""Duck"" Tavern. The meat was chewy and course. I literally could not eat it. I ended up taking it home and searing it on the stove a little. Only then was it edible.  I decided they sorely under-cooked it, even for a medium rare.Organic Chicken: The chicken was tender and juicy. But no part of this dish stood out as anything but a well-cooked chicken.Double Chocolate Layer Cake: Decent tasting, needs more of that ice cream. The espresso I had with it was rather good though.Subpoena Cocktail: I really enjoyed this cocktail, despite the fact that our waiter could not even describe it to me or tell me if it was ""sweet.""  FYI it is on the sweet side but the red pepper adds a nice kick that helps offset the sweetness.On the bright side, the food is remarkably photogenic.",Juliya G.
12,Saint Johns,2018-04-13,dh_loSvnaUG4HuTa89_wwA,5, FL,"My first Michelin-starred restaurant experience was at Blue Duck on Easter 2018. Last minute plans were accommodated with a 9:00 dinner reservation. Browsing thru other Yelp reviews, I came in with a plan. Service was top notch. I've seen ladies and their ""purse hooks"" for tables in restaurants but this establishment provides a personal miniature stool to keep purses off the floor. Wood tables and clean lines throughout provided a modern yet classic ambiance.Our waiter suggested we treat our orders as family style so we could each enjoy various items from the menu. Trying to avoid being too over-bearing with my Yelpness, I patiently waited for the table of 5 to order. I knew if someone didn't order the bone marrow for an appetizer, it would be the definite choice for me. The same thing for the braised beef rib. The table overall did a good job in creating a variety of appetizers with oysters, bone marrow, charcuterie board, and beef tartare. For 5 people this provided a good assortment to share. All were excellent but of course I enjoyed the bone marrow the most. The roasted flavor of marrow and truffle butter was a pleasant symphony with the textures from the oat-thyme streusel then spread on the toast points.For entrees, the table ordered the beef rib (x2), organic chicken, pork shank, and of course the duck breast. While prices did lean towards the $$$ side, rest assured that portion sizes were significant given the quality and detail to each dish. The beef rib serving was enough for two so a substantial amount of food did come home. As much as I wanted to try the apple pie dessert, it simply wasn't going to happen tonight. A 9:00 start on a leisurely dinner with drinks and appetizers just wasn't a formula that ended in dessert. I highly recommend a meal here and have also read great things about their brunch. If I lived in the area, this would be an easy addition to the list for special occasion restaurants.",Edward A.
13,Fort Worth,2018-04-25,4WHhBZSq3nA8tEsOED7-3Q,5, TX,"I was traveling in Washington, and decided to spoil myself by staying at the Park Hyatt in DC. The hotel itself is lovely, but one of the winning features is the Blue Duck Tavern located in the first floor. It was last minute, but I asked if the concierge could do me a favor by booking me a single table at the restaurant the next night. Thankfully, they were able to get me a great seat at 8pm, and since I was staying right upstairs, I decided to indulge. So on to the feast:I had a three course meal with wine pairings for each. So naturally, I had to start with the Fois Gras terrine with pumpkin, apricot compote, honey and toast points. Creamy and rich, the fois gras paired excellently with the accompanying compotes and honey, and I truly savored this dish. I had a lovely glass of pinot gris with this plate. The fois gras is an excellent idea if you're at the Blue Duck Tavern, and I believe the dish is consistently on the menu (even though the menu changes seasonally).The second dish was the seared duck with orange and tomato. The duck was succulent, and bursting with flavor, and was perfect by itself, no side needed. You're served approximately a half duck, so its a significant portion. I paired this dish with a tart Syrah, which offset the slightly sweeter nature of the meat.Finally I finished with an incredible dessert, the butterscotch dessert. It was almost like a pudding, with crunchy pieces and a deep toffee flavor. It was excellent when paired with a glass of Sauternes, even though the Sauternes is by nature a sweeter digestif. Service was decent, although my server wasn't the most friendly at the beginning, and focused much more on the other tables (with couples or larger groups). I did have a decent conversation with him, and afterwards he was much friendlier and hospitable. Afterwards, I slowly wandered back to my room and fell asleep, a full satiated fella. If you're curious, the total cost of my three course meal including wines came out to approximately $100.--------------Keep in mind the restaurant also serves an excellent breakfast, with egg dishes available on request, and a variety of hot and cold dishes that are high quality.I can see why they received a Michelin star, although I would say that some of the service needs to be boosted a bit. It could be that I was a single diner, but that doesn't mean service needs to be reduced to single diners.",Shane F.
14,New York,2018-05-07,L66lNreGIXPnCbEh-s8NLQ,5, NY,"The short: this spot is beautiful, the service is top notch, the open kitchen is super cool and the food is amazing! The longer: I made a reservation to celebrate my birthday on open table, and we were welcomed with personalized menus that said happy birthday. The hostess and waiter both wished me a happy birthday & helped us settle in with delicious glasses of bubbly. We started with oysters, and then went into entrees and sides. I had the whole fish special (red snapper) and my boyfriend had the duck. We had a side of the fries and the mushrooms. The fries are crispy on the outside and like mashed potatoes on the inside. For dessert we had a grapefruit lemon concoction that was amazing. We had such a perfect meal and experience- wouldn't hesitate to come back here, and super appreciative to the staff and culinary crew for helping to make my birthday so special!",Jennifer R.

He was incredibly attentive, friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable. Everything we ordered from start to finish was a party in our mouth.

16,Washington,2018-04-22,1X_rtM7D0f0gA19n-gRY9w,5, DC,"Blue duck tavern was phenomenal. It is a bit pricey, but honestly very reasonable for a Michelin star restaurant and the quality of food and service here. I had to make a weekend brunch reservation about 2-3 weeks in advance, and it was so worth it. We ordered the bone marrow to share. I had never had bone marrow before, but after this experience, I will definitely be having it again. The marrow was fatty and the salt and seasoning on top was so flavorful and flavored the entire marrow. Spread on top of little pieces of roasted bread, also with a little bit of roasted garlic, it was delicious. Super heavy and filling, but so so good. For entree, I got the short rib hash. I would definitely recommend trying this! The short rib was unbelievably tender, and the sauce was sweet and savory. It was absolutely delicious. With a perfectly soft fried egg on top and biscuit on the side, it was one of the best brunch dishes I've ever had. My friends got the shrimp and grits and hot fried chicken sandwich. Both were delicious and would recommend as well. But a must have, stand out is the short rib hash!Amazing experience at blue duck tavern! Great service and beyond great food!",Tonia W.

If you think it's pricy, it's for good reason. The thought and detail they put into their dishes is amazing and you can taste the quality through and through.- The service is one of the best I've had. If you have reservations ahead of time and let them know what type of special occasion it's for (anniversary, birthday, etc.) they'll give you a customized menu that says Happy Anniversary or Happy Birthday X at the top. This type of attention to detail is exactly what brings back customers! You even get to keep these menus as a souvenir ;) On top of that, our server Lewis was EXTREMELY kind, welcoming, and very personable. He has really set the bar for the perfect dining experience. TIPS/RECS:- Do NOT come without reservations (maybe you'll get lucky) but the wait can get long! Luckily, they have a bar to the left of the restaurant and you can wait there until your table is ready- Another reason to come on your anniversary, birthday, or another special occasion is because they usually have a free dessert of some sort for you!-- FOIS GRAS CREME BRÛLÉE (omg so good)-- MOULARD DUCK BREAST (literally any duck they have will be good)-- WOOD OVEN ROASTED BONE MARROWThis is truly what a fine dining restaurant should encompass and I'm a huge fan!",Cindy M.

19,Charlotte,2018-07-16,06X3kcACErh7xHHGGMIQwQ,5, NC,"I was debating between giving this restaurant 4 stars or 5 stars. My server, Michael, was the reason for me writing a 5-star review. I was one of those annoying tourists who made a last minute reservation, and the hostess was very accommodating in finding a spot for me in the very busy restaurant. Once I arrived, I was directed to a quiet corner, and Michael welcomed me to the restaurant and the city (as I definitely looked like a noob!). He shared his favorite dishes, and with his advice, I ended up getting the soft shell crab and the duck.The food was really good, but the food wasn't anything extraordinary. Both the soft shell crab and the duck were cooked to perfection. The soft shell crab had a lot of flavor, and I liked the cucumber and radish complements to the dish. Even though the duck was cooked perfectly, I think there could have been a little bit more flavoring (such as more sweetness) to offset the gamy taste of duck. Again, I'm probably a little picky, so heed caution with my opinion. All in all, the food was delicious!Michael (my server) was the reason though for my enjoyable dining experience. He gave me complimentary cookies and a side of grits (which were delicious), gave me advice on good restaurants in the area, and talked with me throughout the night.

20,Arlington,2018-06-24,4luLHWmO_oraUW54xKN7gg,5, VA,"A friend of mine recommended that I check out Blue Duck Tavern for their desserts, but I figured if I was going, I would do the whole shebang. My boyfriend and I decided to go for our anniversary (definitely makes reservations) so we skipped out on the appetizers so we would have room for dessert. We both got the wood fired butcher's cut steak (it was the cut between the sirloin and New York strip)l that day). You could actually taste the wood influence cooked in, and the steak was covered in red wine jus. We also got the fries as our side. You have to order the sides a la carte but they are shareable for two people, and definitely worth it. I recommend the fries as a side, next time I'm trying the grits per my friend's recommendation. Their wine selection is also amazing. I got a cab and he got a Malbec. For dessert we split the chocolate cake, which I would come back just for that. It was on top of caramel sauce and included smoked vanilla ice cream. The cake was heavenly and I can confirm that I would come back to Blue Duck just to enjoy a dessert. I also had a white port dessert wine with it. I didn't know quite port was a thing but now I will get it whenever I see it on the menu. Our waiter was superb. He knew the menu like the back of his hand and answered every question we had concisely. He also had great table presence and didn't check in too much to be a nuisance but made sure our needs were met. It's nice to be taken care of by someone who understand table etiquette and restaurant body language. When reading reviews I saw a lot about portion sizes being too small, but they were perfect. A lot of other restaurants serve too much food that you feel obligated to finish and you leave feeling stuffed and almost sick. At Blue Duck, everything was so perfectly portioned that you were able to enjoy multiple courses, finish the whole plate, and not get overly full. When leaving Blue Duck you will feel satisfied instead of stuffed.",Katelyn C.

Braised beef rib with stone ground mustard spatzle - 5/5 - super tender savory beef rib smothered in a unique seasoned sauce.Whipped (mashed) bone marrow potato - 5/5 - so unbelievably rich and decadent that the server insisted us to order claiming it to be the best mashed potatoes and he may be right about it!Mandarin custard - 5/5 - absolutely beauty in a cup and an amazing distinct taste. Loved it!Apple pie - 4.5/5 - perhaps the best apple pie, best accompanied with a scoop of vanilla ice cream (that is if you are a fan otherwise it may not impress you at all)Let it linger cocktail - 5/5 - loved it! Oh my darling cocktail -5/5- strong kick with this gin Service: impeccable, attentive and friendly. Special recognition to Frank, our server, who gave us fabulous recommendations Ambience: very fabulous contemporary modern decor with a layout of divided  subsections for privacy",Alex N.
22,Washington,2018-04-04,DmYjPQ_rX3sBmGpAjbVrLw,5, DC,"Amazing food and even more amazing service! I spent years in the foggy bottom area and finally decided to try blue duck tavern. Three words I AM HOOKED! The food is absolutely phenomenal. I made a reservation for brunch and as soon as I was led in I was greeted by the pleasant smell that fills the restaurant. The menu can start to look like everything meshes together so read carefully! To start we had the crab cakes which were amazing! There was absolutely no filler. (Wasn't expecting filler, but still lol) The crab cakes were also topped with caviar which was a nice flare. The short rib hash and the pancakes were entrees that I tried. The hash was cooked to perfection with a very tasty sauce at the bottom of the dish paid with an egg cooked to your liking. The pancakes were amazing and the nuts were a nice addition to the top pancake with the cream. The syrup they serve is nice and light! To drink, I had the lemonade which is definitely made the list for top 5 lemonades I've ever had. The lemonade was fresh and not too tart. I cannot wait to come back to blue duck tavern. I would like to try the dinner soon!",Armani Y.

24,Alexandria,2018-05-29,RiNSnWarJ04mS0l8go20wQ,5, VA,"This was my first Michelin Star restaurant experience. The vibe super modern, sophisticated and romantic. It's definitely what you would expect from a restaurant being inside of the Park Hyatt. The funny thing is, we walked in without a reservation on a weekend. It was about maybe 9:30pm. We were unable to sit in the main dining room , but what's nice is the entire menu is offered in the more casual dining area which is immediately to your left upon walking into the restaurant (where the wall of windows are). I cannot remember our waitress's name, but her service was impeccable. She was patient and very attentive. Everyone was quite pleasant, actually. We started with the bone marrow - superb. I can't even think of any other way to describe it. My boyfriend ordered the burger, and fell in love. I had the chicken and was only slightly impressed by it; I thought it could have been seasoned a bit better. We finished with the apple pie and it was wonderful - not to heavy and sweet; it was absolutely perfect. I think I'd like to revisit during brunch. I definitely give this place 5 stars and highly recommend if you're a foodie in the DC-area.",Alexis B.
25,Washington,2018-03-21,0UrQ2O-j4r4KonSnKmG0Dg,4, DC,"Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in DC. I've come here once for dinner and another time solely to try the apple pie.For dinner, my husband and I ate outside in the patio so highly suggest that if weather permits! We had to try the bone marrow as suggested - very good and filling. Depending on your hunger level this could easily fill you up but 2-3 people is a perfect appetizer portion. I went for the duck and my husband went for the cod. Duck was amazing! Juicy with a slight crisp and the marmalade was a good and not overpowering sweetness to it. -------Now for dessert, it wasn't apple season so they didn't have apple pie available when we went so we decided to come when it was there. I wouldn't say it was my most favorite apple pie ever but it was a unique take on it. I'm not sure if $24 is worth it for the pie but it is very filling. The great thing I enjoyed about the pie was the freshness of the apples. Some apple pies are either too gooey and are overpowered by too much sugar. Blue duck tavern does a great take on it. I'm not sure if our pie had been sitting out in the kitchen, but the filling was a little cold, so it wasn't as enjoyable as I would've hoped.-------This drink may be a seasonal drink but the Cuffing Season was delicious. I believe it was a mix of rum, matcha, banana, and possibly sparkling wine. The banana kind of threw me off but surprisingly it was very good and hopefully it'll be there when I return!",Cassie P.
26,Baltimore,2018-06-12,Z4TpPtISetZWgbE-swgAQQ,5, MD,"A very nice Michelin one star experience on our anniversary. The first minute we came in, they welcomed us with a special menu just for us, with Happy Anniversary on the top of the menu. There aren't too many non-alcoholic drink options, but the pineapple-mango drink we ordered was really refreshing. The main dishes all tastes pretty good and were in huge portions, we clearly ordered too much: bone marrow, roasted whole fish, and moulard duck breast. The duck breast was sooo rich and was cooked right to the spot. The whole fish was crispy on the outside and tender inside, seasoned well, but we just cannot finish the arm-long whole fish! I have to admit I didn't enjoy their star dish bone marrow that much, felt there was too much salt and grease :-(The desserts were just ok though, the coconut tapioca definitely needs more liquid/ice to buffer the thick texture. They generously offered us a complimentary double layer chocolate cake, pretty standard, again, may need more ice cream to buffer the heavy taste, but we just had so much meat!Overall, we had a really nice and intimate experience here, the gentleman served us was very attentive but still gave us some private space to talk. And the take-out box was really cute :-)",Xinting Y.
27,Oxon Hill,2018-05-25,c6ONgY5jYTs8nCzg-Jh8Fg,4, MD,"Enjoyed a wonderful breakfast date at Blue Duck Tavern.  On our day off from work, my husband and I enjoyed breakfast at this Michelin star restaurant.  We were seated promptly upon arrival.  It was about 10 am and the restaurant was busy, with a combination of business and couples/families.  Our server was attentive.  He immediately offered water.  We ordered coffee and a cappuccino.  Both were hot, strong and the cappuccino, well crafted.  We ordered the jumbo lump crab scrambled eggs, and the Short rib hash.  Both super delicious and highly recommended.  The crab scrambled eggs had chunks of crab, was fluffy and perfectly seasoned.  The avocado creaminess and the spinach and tomatoes were a perfect addition to the egg whites.  And the multigrain bread was so delicious.  The short rib hash was simply perfect.  The short rib was flavorful and so tender.  I adored the taste of mustard and the slight pungent spiciness of the horseradish sauce.  But the real show stopper was the perfection of the sunny side up egg.  Breaking the yolk on top of the tender, mustardy short rib, elevated the dish.  The velvety taste and texture was perfection.  In addition, we ordered the trio of house made pastries, not impressed.  I found the pastries to be just ok, not special.   The muffins were too sweet and heavy.  The croissant was not buttery or flaky.  On the other hand, the berry jam served with the pastries was the best jam I have ever had.  Service was attentive and on point.  The reason why I won't give this place 5 stars is because we really wanted to enjoy a mimosa and a Bloody Mary, but they were unable to serve, because the bar was closed.  Just unacceptable.  I saw bottles of sparkling wine, they obviously had juice.  So, in my opinion, a Michelin Star Restaurant must be prepared to say yes, if a customer requests something.  I asked my husband if he would return, he said, he rather try a new place.  But, go, you will not be disappointed with food at Blue Duck.",Jennifer G.

Huge pieces of crab with not too much sauce.Short Rib Hash $22: Great flavors in this hefty dish. Comes with a biscuit to round out the dish.Hand Cut BDT Fries $11: This was an interesting dish.

The atmosphere of Blue Duck Tavern is modern and sophisticated. It is what you would expect of a restaurant located inside the Park Hyatt.The brunch menu was playful and delicious. We ordered the following dishes to share: (i) bone marrow; (ii) crab cakes; (iii) hot fried chicken on biscuit; and (iv) the mandarin pudding. While I enjoyed all of the dishes, the bone marrow and the hot fried chicken biscuits were a stand-out. The play on unique flavours and the use of fresh ingredients made the dishes stand out.  I should note that the mandarin pudding was light and refreshing. It was a nice way to finish brunch. I will be back for dinner.",Roland H.
30,Washington,2018-03-29,_7K24MD-sCiKMwS4wmNnzw,5, DC,"Went to blue duck tavern for an impromptu date night with my wife. This is a Michelin rated restaurant inside the Park Hyatt hotel - which I love. The place is absolutely gorgeous in all details. To just mention one - the chairs. Solid wood, perfectly and ergonomically sculpted so that it perfectly comfortable to sit in for long periods. It's that attention to detail that makes this place so beautiful. We ordered bone marrow and a charcuterie board for appetizer.  The presentation was super well done and the taste fantastic. The main course was duck and the butcher's cut with a shared side of mushrooms. We also had a bottle of nice Burgundy wine.  Every again well presented, well attended by staff. Basically I have nothing negative to report. One thing that I want to emphasize is that I told them we were gluten intolerant when I reserved and they were aware when we arrived. We were served gluten free bread and the waiter advised us on selections and modifications without us having to prompt them.  Perfect touch.",Jose P.
31,Fort Washington,2018-06-05,D5-FfiH-MWmGp-1rRq_vPw,3, MD,For my 30th celebration i can say this was an ok choice. The food was mediocre. The short rib it was soft and tender but no flavor and dying for some salt. The ceviche at first taste was oh i like but then was lacking in lemon and salt. And you couldn't ask the waiter for anything it took her an hour to check on us. Literally dying of thirst because we sat in the glass booth which was cute but hot. Per my sister the burger was excellent so that i can recommend. Ended night with double chocolate cake with honey rice crispy omg so good. If you like smoke bacon flavored ice cream you'll like the scoop that came on top. New flavor experience.,Fatima F.
32,Arlington,2018-03-10,sqBqYJk5SHueelo4Mmbb6Q,4, VA,"Love the aesthetic (clean lines, modern, tons of natural light, and a semi-exposed kitchen). I've only eaten here for breakfast before (not sure I could afford dinner), but I adore the seasonal waffles (the gingerbread waffles this winter were delicious, but overall, the flavors are never quite as adventurous as Founding Farmers down the street). Also love the cheese plate - one of the best in the city (I can't ever pass on a cheese plate).Honestly, worth coming here just to eat at a Michelin rated restaurant. Breakfast is expensive, but not ridiculous, especially given that it is situated between Foggy Bottom and Georgetown. Delicious coffee and the tables by the windows at the front are a fantastic place to catch up with friends or host a client meeting! I wish I had more excuses to dine at this establishment and trust that I will be making some up in the coming months because I suspect the outdoor seating area is perfect in spring!AccessibilityI believe the restaurant is wheelchair accessible, but have not yet checked out the restroom. Lighting is mostly natural and can't be dim in certain sections. Acoustics are good-- never gets overbearingly loud and I'm sensitive to noise.",Tailor D.

For entrees we got the Brunch Burger and the Short Rib Hash. Pro-tip: brussel sprouts are not overhyped, definitely order them!Service was top-notch and the spacing of the restaurant adds to the experience.But after the meal we felt super sluggish given the generous amount of oil used to cook the food. On the fence between 4 and 5 stars but was not WOWed enough by the food to warrant a 5, especially given the Michelin Star. Still could not go wrong with Blue Duck though for any occasion!",Tony R.
34,Washington,2018-05-27,0303UyDs7KlJZdeG2FEjAg,5, DC,"I'm always in support of DC restaurants getting more Michelin recognition. I'm glad Blue Duck Tavern is one of them.Walk through the impressively tall double doors and you're going to enter an intimately lit, open kitchen concept restaurant with modest flavor profiles but expert execution.I've been here twice now, both for celebratory occasions and the service has been great both times.In our most recent trip we started with the Foie Gras Creme Brûlée (mainly out of curiosity) and the Bone Marrow. The bone marrow was amazing. They came out with 3 generously sized bones, and the flavors were well built. I especially liked the pretzel crumble that provided great texture. As for the foie gras creme brûlée. I prefer my foie gras unadulterated but they pulled off the creme brûlée treatment.I got the Moulard Duck Breast as my entree. It was solid. Wasn't a huge fan of the marmalade but didn't dislike it either. Also, you have to get their ""BDT fries"", it's basically like if fries and patatas bravas had a baby For dessert, you have to try their cherry cobbler. It came out piping hot in a small skillet. The cherry filling wasn't too sweet and the biscuit layer on top was baked well. We also got a complimentary strawberry parfait that was very good too!",Ki Y.

I am a picky drinker so there was a lady who suggested a very good drink to me. Service here was good. No complaints. The food was also very good. Had the bone marrow for appetizer, and then beef brisket, and ice cream for desert. They did clean the table and give new silverware and plates after every course.I did notice something the server seemed to be sweating a lot as he talked to us. He was very nice but he seemed uncomfortably drenched in sweat. He explained the menu to me, made sure none of the entrees I selected had any ingredients I was allergic to.

37,Seattle,2018-07-02,qlpQ0WBPcKK4pY_LzbIOxw,3, WA,"Overall - nice place for a brunch out in the city. Great service, great food, great drinks. A bit on the pricey side for a casual brunch & the value.Pros - cheap for a Michelin star restaurant. We visited without a reservation on a Saturday afternoon and we were seated within 10 minutes. Service was excellent and the staff were friendly, professional, and prompt.Cons - the service was better than the food. We ordered the sticky pecan buns, the bone marrow appetizers, and the short rib hash. The waiter suggested us to get the sticky pecan buns as it was a fan favorite, but I've had far better at bakeries. The marrow was good, but the toppings they put on (bourbon chili butter, pretzel crumble, whole roasted garlic on the side) didn't elevate the flavors to be exceptional above any high quality bone marrow. The short rib hash was tasty but again, not anything out of the ordinary.",Jaesung J.
38,East Bay,2018-01-27,lTXOaJoNgAILkB_lmKLmpA,4, CA,"All in all, great prices and options for brunch (definitely want to try the crab cake and pecan sticky buns next time)!Food: I was too full, so I was thinking of just ordering juice, but I also wanted to try Blue Duck Tavern's brunch items. I normally go for the sweet brunch options, but there were more savory options, so I decided to give them a try. Both the short rib hash and the brunch burger were better than the pictures and better than my expectations. I devoured both dishes. I wasn't a fan of the fries that came with the burger, but this is just a matter of preference with how you like your potatoes.Service: The one star off is due to our server. Our server appeared to be new and there were numerous times when I tried to wave her down, because we needed something, but she wouldn't notice us. Fortunately, the other experienced servers would notice us from the other side of the hall and helped us. I wouldn't take a star off for this.Then, I saw her pick up a rag to clean the table next to us before they got their next dishes...unfortunately, I also saw how disgusting the rag was, and she saw it too. She decided to hide that by putting that side face down, and started to ""clean"" their table. She got lucky because the table was busy conversing. Our table was wiped down by someone else who used a new napkin. I know she's training, so probably needs more time; however, this is a Michelin-starred restaurant within the Park Hyatt.",Crystal K.

41,Durham,2018-05-13,2QkEmM5whDKBt4375anhhQ,3, NC,"Y'all - I've been a Yelp Elite reviewer for almost ten years now, and this was the first Michelin rated restaurant I have ever been to, so let's just say my expectations were enormously high.I am sad to say that I was utterly disappointed. Do I think the food was of high quality and prepared exceptionally? Yes...but it was all just so underwhelming.The portions were small and the entire plate lacked cohesion. I was expecting masterpieces and I feel like I got served something far less. Don't get me wrong, the pancake, omelet, and waffle were tasty, but it's something I would have expected from a normal restaurant, not a Michelin star. I'll dig a bit deeper on the omelet. It was prepared well: definitely not overcooked but rather slightly undercooked as the white was a bit runny. That is fine, but I probably expected it to be cooked just done. Because it was still undercooked, it had that eggy smell that sometimes permeates when it is undercooked and has been sitting out. The spinach and goat cheese were fine. The tomato confit was also good, but it didn't seem like a confit. Seems like it should have been cooked a bit longer. I thought the peppercorns were a nice touch though.I also enjoyed my sourdough or baguette slices with the apple butter (I think that's what it was), but I wasn't sure why it came with my meal. The bread was fine, but maybe a more savory spread to pair? Like seasonal herb butter? I didn't really get to delve into the pancake and waffle but my friend's also thought they were not out-of-this-world and portioned small. While I don't think we'll be going back, we do wish that we got starters and dessert to complete the entire experience, and it's possible that could have changed our mind.One last note, my two friends got iced coffee. I expected the coffee to be housemade, but it was served out of a can. While it was tasty (I did try it), I didn't see the can coming from a Michelin star.Oh well, guess I'll have to give it a go at another Michelin-rated restaurant.",Tanya A.
42,Belvedere Tiburon,2018-05-10,wIhGRyCZBlxfno3SlnlGjA,5, CA,Visiting DC for business and on a recommendation from a co-worker came here for solo dinner. WOW!!  Fantastic meal. I wish I could have kept going and tried everything on the menu. All of the dishes were amazing. Started with the bone marrow appetizer and I really tried to eat the whole thing by myself....  it was that good!!  The portions are huge though and I knew I needed to pace myself to make it through the rest of the meal. I ordered the asparagus (in season) and the duck breast for my main entree. Both dishes were perfection. I think the duck is probably the best preparation I've ever tasted. The crispy skin side was a little piece of heaven. I wish I could have eaten it all or had a dessert. The portions are big and being solo this trip I skipped dessert but the two tables next to me both got the Myers lemon cake. Presentation is stunning and they finished it. Wonderful ambiance and I would love to come back with a larger party to get to try more of these dishes. A must do when in DC!,Karen C.
43,Tustin,2017-12-12,5MDfdpRBdoJVUcJp_47Q_A,4, CA,"There are so many Michelin 1 star restaurants now a days that having a 1 star seems more like a marketing gimmick than to really state that the food and server is superior than other restaurants. The food and server here is great, but I have had the same great food and service at many other restaurants without a Michelin star. Bone Marrow: If you are a marrow fan, you gotta order this dish. The fattiness of the bone marrow pairs extremely well with the crunch thick toast. Because the bone marrow is so fatty, you need something more solid to cut through the fattiness. The baked BBQ sauce provides a interesting favor twist to the whole dish that I've never experience elsewhere.Duck Breast: Wow! The duck breast were cooked medium rare with a hint of smokiness. The skins were extremely crispy, yet the meat inside were still left tender and juicy. The breast meat had me at hello! There were also the breast meet, which had no gammy taste at all.Mushroom Sated in Beef Fat: These mushroom were divine. I mean, come on, the mushroom has soaked up all the beef fat, so it gotta taste good right. I do love that the chief uses more than one type of mushroom and also added spinach for a touch of green.Apple Pie with Ice-Creme: This apple pie is mean tot be shared by 2 people for sure. This is definitely not your normal slice of apple pie. You get a whole miniature pie with the buttery flaky crust surrounding the crispy semi-sweet cinnamon apples. The ice-creme are a-la-cart, so you'll need to add that on if you want ice-creme with your pie.",Rosemary T.
44,Westport,2018-04-17,PzlYjd30Cj1wKp1Jx3lqUQ,5, CT,"The Blue Duck tavern is the best American restaurant in DC.  I'm going to wax poetic here for a moment, so bear with me.I've been to DC many times, for work and for pleasure.  It is a wonderful place to visit, because as an outsider, it's monuments and institutions remind you of the profound ideals, and aspirational words, that form the bedrock of our great experiment in self-governance.  Those words are literally carved into stone all over the city, and imbue you with a sense of pride, and responsibility.  The monuments have their desired effect - highlighting the best of America, and reminding us of our best selves.Living in the beltway, however, seems to beat you into a craven cynic in short order.  So best to get in and get out, I guess.Anyhoo, the Blue Duck, and the Park Hyatt in which it stands, chose colonial America as an aesthetic, to tremendous effect.  Shaker furniture, clean, simple lines, fine woods, and a puritan minimalism all work together to hit deeply American notes, and the fact that it all works without looking like a Vermont B&B is truly an achievement.  It feels luxe and elegant and totally modern, and unlike any other DC restaurants in its class, which tend towards overblown formality, precious detail, and obsequious service.  Like the city itself, it turns a mirror to America, reflecting a very flattering image.  Those same notes are echoed in the menu, which features locally-sourced fin, hoof and foul prepared expertly, and extraordinary duck fat fries, and apple pie.  I had the ""rockfish,"" which is the Chesapeake Bay term for Striped Bass, my wife had the succulent roast chicken, and my girls had a burger (phenomenal) and buttered pasta off the kids menu.  All excellent.  All American.  We erred only in missing the artisanal cider on the menu, which would have been perfect accompaniment, instead having a nice local Virginian Vermentino wine.  The wine list is very deep, separated into New World and Old World selections, so oenophiles can still drop $1200 on a '15 Clos de Tart Monopole Morey-St.-Denis, if the company is buying.It's hard to get a Michelin star.  It's really hard to get a Michelin star without tablecloths.  Blue Duck deserves the accolades.",Richard H.

46,Atlanta,2018-07-01,ov5lMvApKuGMRfanq3KWKA,5, GA,"This place received a Michelin Star three weeks ago, so we decided to come here for breakfast on Sunday morning.  There was plenty of seating available, though finding street parking was difficult.  My first dish was muesli, which was oatmeal and fruit. The waiter explained that the oats had soaked in milk overnight. I did find this taste refreshing and good, since it was not heavy.  Next I had the anson mills white corn grits.  The grits were mixed with Italian cheese and topped with carmelized onions.  The onions sweetened the grits! I did enjoy the grit dish and the addition of Italian cheese was very good. My wife had the BDT breakfast sandwich that came with an egg on top of the open-faced burger.  This also came with hand-cut fried potatoes. The dish was nicely laid out, artistically speaking.  She loved the burger.  We found the potatoes to be cooked just right and not greasy-  yes I tried them.  The waiter and staff were excellent. Our waiter took the time to explain our dishes and answer our questions.  When you enter the restaurant, you notice that the kitchen has an open view that allows one to observe the operations of the kitchen staff.  The cost for our breakfast was $58.  Finally, this was an enjoyable experience and we will go back. Afterwards, We enjoyed sitting in the rocking chairs, in front of the restaurant.In 2018 we came here for lunch. I had bone marrow as an appetizer.  The Bone marrow was served with bread.  It had a strong burnt spicy taste that went well with bread.  Came with a cooked onion.  I had roasted Chicken and sauce.  The sauce had onion, and garlic butter.  The sauce had a weak taste that complimented the chicken. I enjoyed the chicken and bone marrow. The service remade excellent as always.   The total cost of lunch for the four of us was $145. So I do recommend the BluedTavern has a place to go for breakfast and lunch.",Stephen M.
47,Arlington,2017-12-22,VoNacEvv6p-qVmwWfHdFtQ,5, VA,"It is with great anticipation that once a year, the wife and I make our yearly trek to the Blue Duck Tavern (BDT) for our engagement anniversary. Never mind the hubbub that surrounds a restaurant that has been bestowed a Michelin star, for after all, that is merely a symbol of the underlying worth. The underlying worth? Food, service, and value.Food: If you've been to BDT before, you know the drill. The Wood Oven-Roasted Bone Marrow is really all you need to satisfy your BDT cravings. However, a taste of that fatty, succulent, bone marrow will cause you to desire much more. This time, our two entrees we opted for were the Oven-Roasted Veal Rack - a new menu item - and the Skuna Bay Salmon. While the salmon was nicely prepared and well-done, it was a tad small in portion and a bit underwhelming. Good, but not great. Now, the veal though was where my faith in BDT was restored. The watercress creme and the bordelaise sauce complemented the low-key flavor of the veal. During orders, our waitress properly advised that the veal would be a lighter option in lieu of the braised beef ribs and the butcher's cut steak that people may opt for. This was actually a smart choice - going with the veal - as the bone marrow and our butternut squash soup of the day had already heavily weighed us down. Veal? Yes please. The best part is that even the day-after with leftovers, the veal tasted fantastic.We rounded out our meal with the usual hand-cut BDT fries because you know you love that spicy aioli sauce. Service: In another stand-up performance, our waitress and waiters were the best that you can expect. From the explanations of each entree as they arrived, to the balancing act of being attentive but not overly attentive, we were treated like kings and queens. Value: As all astute restaurant go-ers will know, value is subjective. While it is primarily based on numbers, the actual value fluctuates depending on the quality of the food and service. You certainly can have an expensive meal at a good value, because you found your heart to be content and your belly filled to capacity with only the best ingredients and flavors that man has to offer. BDT hits that mark once again. Honestly though, with the average price of an entree around $35, you are getting huge (extra yuge) value for your money. Parting Words: If you are a man (or woman, no sexism) of faith and in need of a spiritual revival, make no mistake that your spirits will be lifted and the glory of the Lord revealed (extra Ezekiel). Songs and praises to the one true God were offered not once, but three times throughout the evening. Once during the first taste of the luxurious oven-roasted bone marrow, a second time during the oven-roasted veal rack, and lastly during our indulgence of the BDT fries. No visit to BDT has ever left me without a higher adoration for the one true God.TL;DR: Remember to utter these words when you're placing your orders, ""bone-marrow please."" Beyond that, it's hard to go wrong with any of the menu items, although I have a strong preference for their meat and poultry options. Never disappointed. For some carbs? Snatch up the Hand-Cut BDT Fries and you'll have soft potatoes oozing into your mouth in no time.",Richard L.
48,Alexandria,2018-03-20,ZvgP5yHKl9onweNj0GB8EQ,5, VA,"I'm under the impression that whomever owns BDT is a fan of and a master at Hide & Seek. I must've stood on the corner of M & 24th for 10 mins staring blankly in each direction trying to locate this place. I finally gave in & asked a passerby where in the hell-o I'm lost is it? They pointed me in the direction of the Hyatt smack in front of me where the signage is designed for only the EXTREMELY attentive. I walked into the hotel and proceeded to wander around the corridor searching for the entrance and the host podium. Yeah... again...I had to ask at the bar where that was too. It's located in the restaurant, around a corner, by a window... you will NEVER find it... they didn't think that placement thru. After failing twice, clearly,... I'm it. Olly olly oxenfreee!At this point I'm 5 mins late for my 1230 Saturday Brunch reservation but it's ok... they recovered beautifully and the minor inconvenience is forgivable. The restaurant itself is quite lovely with floor to ceiling windows facing the street, lots of natural light, beautiful sophisticated decor and lots of smiling, blue blazered wait staff hurriedly yet carefully attending to their patrons. I was sat immediately at a cute lil 2 top with cushioned, armed chairs, facing along the windows... so comfy. My waitress Meheret was a complete joy to have as she was so knowledgeable of their menu, had brilliant recommendations, great small talk and smile to match, and was most attentive to my every request. A good server REALLY brings a dining experience to life. A+.NOW... the food was probably in the bible somewhere... like thou shalt not steal or kill and thine arse should eat the Bone Marrow appetizer or suffer poor decisions for life. That appetizer is if nothing else, a revelation. Rich, impressively presented, savory, decadent... just sex on a tin plate. Lying on a bed of coarse salt like this is normal, it's easily one of the best things I've eaten in DC...(and I eat...ALOT bro.) Lol... so good. The entree I went with was the Braised Short Rib, which came with a huge biscuit and the pulled ribs sat under my  favorite thing...a sunny side up egg. OHHHHH egg porn. Gets the people GOING! :) In my humble opinion, this dish was tasty and according to Meheret very popular... but I feel the appetizer is so hard to beat, I was far less impressed with my entree. No points lost though because I just already found my main dish...I had no desire for a side dish. My heart belongs to the marrow. Sorry but not really. I also had 2 delish drinks... sorbet mimosas in Key Lime & Black Currant which both come with rock candy lollis to stir the sorbet. The cats pajamas is what they are! Next time, I'll try ""cuffing season"" ... the names of the drinks tickled me inside and out. ANYHOO...Such a wonderful experience and worth every penny of the top dollar pricing. Justified and I'll definitely be back. If you go... I'm available to tag along. LOL 5/5 boughie tummy rubs.",Ijene L.

51,Hoboken,2018-04-22,cWHpoccHbbVxtUarDv0w6g,2, NJ,"For a michelin star restaurant, the service was a complete disappointment, from seating to the end. The lady that seated us, possibly name Nina, had made a comment under her breath (but clearly loud enough to hear) that she didn't like the attitude when someone at our table had asked about a quiet seating area. Before that even, seating was very slow but the staff grumbling about a simple question of not being in a noisy area was uncomfortable and inappropriate. Additionally, they started clearing plates from two people at the table while two others were still eating and even tried to take their plate. This is not a cheap restaurant, to rush our meal was again, not polite. I will note in fairness, most of the food was good, but the service was completely disappointing. Would be 1 star if based on service alone.",Corinne B.

To me it is clear why this restaurant is one of the few Michelin Star restaurants in DC, and I definitely think it is worth the time and money.If you are going for brunch, I would recommend the crab cakes and the pancakes! The pancakes are absolutely incredible- savory and sweet. The side of Brussels sprouts are also some of the best I have ever had- and I eat a lot of Brussels sprouts! The desserts are also amazing. When I recently went, there was a butternut squash cake. I have never had anything like this before and it was absolutely delicious. There is a also chocolate custard dessert that is unique and extremely tasty!",Kiva M.
54,Watertown,2018-03-21,Dq6I24m_xj8c8N0k9S8g0A,5, MA,"SCRUMPTIOUS BREAKFAST1-Michelin-starred treat in DC's Georgetown area. Awash in natural light. Surrounded by well-made Shaker furniture. And other guests. (The 1-2 seat tables are placed in close vicinity of one another - it's easy to overhear conversations.)If you choose one dish, this might be it: the Jumbo Crab Lump with Egg Whites with Tomato, Baby Spinach, Avocado, Cream Cheese, Multigrain Bread ($19) is beautiful on the palette. The bread, toasted to just the right crustiness, scoops up the springy, gooey egg white, and gives a delightful contrast of texture and taste that's delicate, but to be remembered. It's a filling breakfast too. Had coffee to go with it. Hyatt Globalist's $30 breakfast credit inclusive of tax and gratuity, covered the breakfast.(A similar dish at Park Hyatt New York's breakfast - Maine Lobster Egg White Scramble, Avocado, Spinach, Preserved Lemon, Tarragon ($32) - although good, doesn't have those toasts, and such memorable textures).",Yelp A.

We got grits, mushrooms, and fries and it was all terrible. We started with beef tartar which was not good at all but the bone marrow was decent. The wine and wine list was good. They don't serve ice cream in the large marble bowls and it doesn't taste homemade either.I gave it 2 stars bc service is still great there but this oldie is no longer a goodie.

56,Washington,2017-09-20,s2DGdLbplCP4jSTVC8bekg,5, DC,"MY GOD! I was honestly blown away by my birthday dinner at Blue Duck Tavern. My first experience at a Michelin star restaurant was everythang I expected and then some. Blue Duck is definitely a gorgeous, elegantly decorated restaurant, but the vibe is a lot more casual than you'd expect. Some patrons were slightly dressed up, but many were also just hanging out in their Jordans, and it seemed to be totally acceptable. Our waiter, who was an absolute GEM, took care of us from the moment we sat down at the table. We started with a drink order - Will C. had their Broken Patio Furniture and I had Sancho's Boy. Both drinks were fantastic! His was cool and refreshing while mine had that perfect balance between sweet and spicy. For our appetizer, we ordered the octopus, which is served chilled with pickled cauliflower and curried popcorn. I enjoyed each component of the appetizer separately, but together it was a little...all over the place? The appetizer was probably my least favorite part of the meal, but it did not take away from what was otherwise an outstanding dining experience.For our entrees, we had the Moulard Duck Breast and the lamb. Both were PHENOMENAL. The duck, especially, left a lasting impression. I don't think I've ever had duck that was that complex in flavor. The meat itself was extremely tender, and the thin lining of fat around the duck provided the perfect caramelization and slight crunch. The lamb was also excellent, probably the best lamb I've ever had. Melt-in-your-mouth good. Arguably, the best part of the entire meal was the dessert. I heard great things about the pie served at Blue Duck Tavern, and it seriously delivered. The pie comes with a scoop of housemade vanilla bean ice cream (to die for), and the dessert is probably large enough to serve 3. The peach pie is only being served for one more week, accordinng to our waiter, and the restaurant will revert back to apple pie. The peach pie was !@#$%. Words can't describe. The crust was so flaky and buttery and the peaches were so sweet and cinnamon-y. We ended up taking the pie home and having the rest for breakfast the next morning. It still tasted just as good. The meal I had at Blue Duck is probably the best meal I've had this year. Definitely coming back in the future when I need to treat myself!- Valet service available. If you don't have cash, they'll add the charge onto your bill.- Make a res!- PEACH. PIE.",Alexis K.

58,Washington,2017-12-13,8pGd8scNfV_u3_3YtBmJvg,3, DC,"Went here for brunch over the weekend with the gf. For starters we ordered the crab cake and the bone marrow. Jumbo Lump Crab Cake (3.5/5): The crab cake was overall solid, but it was a little small for the price, and it could have been seasoned more. The roe was a nice touch, and the lobster aoili was good, but there could have been a bit more to help with the lack of flavor. It was a good, but not great crab cake, and there are definitely better options in DC. Wood Oven-Roasted Bone Marrow (4.5/5): This was the best dish we had. The bone marrow was flavorful, and had a nice textural contrast with the bread. The charred lime brought the whole dish together with the needed acid. Entrées were the burger and the breakfast sandwich. Apparently the kitchen was overly busy, and they gave us a fruit plate for the delay. We didn't notice the wait for the food, and the fruit plate was a nice gesture. BDT Brunch Burger and BDT Fries (2/5): My girlfriend asked for the burger medium, but it was very well-done instead. The burger was dry and crumbly, which was pretty disappointing. The garlic aoili, like the lobster aoili, was flavorful and helped deal with the dryness of the burger. It was also a good dipping sauce for the fries. Unfortunately, the burger was quite lackluster, and comparatively, a shake shack burger or five guys would have been better than this. The fries were essentially rectangular potato wedges. The presentation was cool, but that was probably the best part of the fries. Like the other dishes, the fries seemed underseasoned. BDT Breakfast Sandwich (3/5): The two pieces of whiskey glazed pork belly were cooked well and were tasty on their own, and the sunny side up egg was cooked well too. The collared greens marmalade was a bit too sweet, and didn't really contribute anything to the dish. The squash kraut added a nice contrast in flavor that the sandwich definitely needed. Overall, the sandwich was too sweet with the combination of the marmalade and the whisky glazed pork. Similar to the crab cake, the sizing seemed off. Cocktails: Sorbet mimosas were good and not overly sweet and had rock candy sticks in them. The bloody Maria was good as well, but nothing spectacular. We also got two little peppermint fudges. These were great, and not overly pepperminty, which both of us appreciated. It's entirely possible it was an off day for the kitchen, but it was a lackluster brunch.",Garrett M.

60,Arlington,2018-02-28,v-68mSPTsHyiZKswROCH4w,5, VA,"This place is truly amazing. My girlfriend and I decided to try this place for our anniversary and everything was exceptional.We attended on a Friday evening and even though there was a lot of traffic around the restaurant/hotel, I was able to find street parking after a couple passes around the block. Getting to the hostess by entering through hotel entrance is a bit confusing, but after asking someone they kindly showed me the way. Our server was Kumar and he did an exceptional job the whole night. He started out by offering us a glass of champagne to celebrate the occasion (I put a note about the anniversary in the reservation) and went over the ins and outs of menu. After finishing the champagne we each ordered a drink (me a Black Beauty and my girlfriend the Oh My Darling) both of which were delicious with my girlfriend even claiming it was the best cocktail she had ever had! We started the dinner service with the Roasted Cauliflower and the Lobster Bisque (the soup of the day) along with the bread basket that had a delicious cranberry bread. After the appetizer we ordered the Duck Breast and Chicken while sharing the fries. Both entrees were great and the portions were good as well. The fries were something different, almost a hash brown, but delicious regardless.At the end of the meal we had trouble deciding between the Shoo Fly Cake and the Poached Pear Dumpling but ultimately decided to go with the later. Much to our surprise though, Kumar brought out both desserts and said that he wanted us to be able to try both, which was an awesome touch to the end the dinner!Overall, this place is amazing and the kitchen is kind of set up in an open fashion so while you are arriving or leaving you walk by the different food prep stations. The food was some of the best I've had in the city and I would highly recommend this place for anyone celebrating a special occasion or just looking for a fancy dinner!",Alexander C.
61,San Diego,2017-09-19,L-hx2Mq0LuoaJMNKhPOm0Q,3, CA,"I really wanted to like this place, as it was awarded a Michelin Star and a lot of people raved about the food. We ordered the bone marrow, foie gras terrine, house cut fries, lamb loin, and duck breast. The bone marrow is something that people talk about a lot, and while I enjoyed the dish the braised beef they top the actual bone marrow with overpowers the fattiness of the marrow itself. We ended up scraping off the beef and just eating the marrow. The foie gras terrine only left one impression in my mind: salty. Although it is paired with a French toast like bread and a marmalade jam, it still could not balance how salty the foie was by itself. Would never order it again. House cut fries in a single word were disappointing. They tasted like an under fried version of Mcdonalds hash browns but at 10x the price. I enjoy hash browns from Mcdonalds way more. The lamb loin was hands down the best dish of the evening. Cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor. It was the most expensive item on the menu at around $40. Duck breast was okay, probably a 6.5 or 7 out of 10. It wasn't bad by any means, but it was in no way amazing. Considering this place is known for their duck I expected more.If I'm ever in D.C. again, I wouldn't return.",Jess W.
62,Chicago,2017-08-30,D_8ejPuYQO7gt4VEdDVJuA,5, IL,"When writing reviews I typically reserve 5-star ratings for places I would go out of my way to revisit. I usually check a place out 2-3 times if I suspect they deserve 5-stars to ensure consistency. I'm straying away this time because I'm so confident Blue Duck Tavern can be trusted. We started off with a couple cocktails and the Wood Oven-Roasted Bone Marrow. This is one of their signature dishes and is easily the best preparation I've come across. The richness and umami delicately balanced on this plate is beyond reproach. Chicken n' Waffles or Chicken n' Biscuits are the trendy item served on just about every brunch menu across the country. More often than not I find it to be underwhelming. BDT's Hot-Fried Chicken Biscuit sets the new standard for me. Starting with the buttery flakey homemade biscuit, I next found the crispy chicken to be seasoned throughout. They must've brined the chicken the night before everso cautiously avoiding over-brining. I hate when over-brining transforms chicken into rubbery hockey pucks. Not the case here at all. Tender, well seasoned and juicy through and through.The Short Rib Hash is marinated 2 days and  braised 18 hours before being topped with an olive oil poached sunny egg and horseradish sauce. The time and care put in this hash is evident in each bite.The only letdown were the BDT fries. They're essentially mash potatoes shaped and fried. They desperately needed flavor. Scallions, garlic or even adding butter to the mix would've gone a long way. Our server seemed a bit nervous. I suspect he was a new employee, but did an outstanding job. I strongly recommend making your way here for brunch if you are anywhere near the DMV area.",Christopher V.
63,Seattle,2017-10-22,yAjrel2v9X2ZoxJ9cpn7qQ,5, WA,"I mean, this restaurant has a Michelin Star for a reason. We had such an amazing dinner there. We were greeted and seated promptly. All of our questions about the menu were answered immediately or checked on with the chef. The sommelier helped us pair wonderful wines with each course. We had sweet potato soup as a starter and it was fantastic! It was the perfect temperature and consistency. It was followed by Cod, ""fries"", and broccoli. We couldn't get past the amazing fries. The shape and presentation made them so much more than your usual fry. The broccoli was also seasoned and cooked to perfection. The cod seemed like a side compared to the other two dishes, but not in a bad way. That's just how good the soup and sides were! Since it was our anniversary they brought out two flavors of their handmade ice creams. Despite the fact that we were stuffed, we finished both no problem thanks to the delectable flavors.

Walking in the host station is faced away from the door which allowed for the hosts to stare at the computers before greeting guests immediately.

DRINK: oh my darling- gin, passion fruit and honey was delicious and strong I love passion fruit so this drink was awesome. FOOD: rockfish- loved the flavors, seasoning was good but the skin wasn't able to stay crispy because the wilted spinach was on top of the fish and not on the bottom of the plateButchers cut- perfect medium rare, awesome house made steak sauce Mushrooms- perfectly acidic and garlicy HUGE portion Fries- so these fries are mashed potatoes shaped into molds and then flash fried to have a nice crisp outside and smooth creamy inside YUM This was more than enough food for two with the complimentary bread and clarified butter as well as a few complimentary bites of butter pecan bar at the end!

For drinks, we had the Mary & Berry and the Mixed Berry Sorbet Mimosa. Both drinks were great, but beware, the sorbet mimosa is very, very sweet, it even comes with rock candy! Our meals were the Braised Beef Short Ribs with Fried Egg and Hash, and the Pancake with Poppy Seeds, Blueberry Compote, Whipped Cream and Bay Leave Crumbles. The short ribs were delicious, the pancake was ok, I probably won't order again. The poppy seeds were a bit overwhelming, it literally tasted like a poppy seed muffin with blueberries on top!

74,Washington,2018-01-30,WjO9cyPFnaxHq56eVs-zbA,5, DC,"Blue Duck Tavern is my go to for when I just want a guaranteed good brunch meal. I've been here numerous times and it's always a pleasure. One thing I like/dislike about the Blue Duck Tavern is the seasonal menu.I like it, because it gives you the opportunity to try different dishes throughout the year. I dislike this because I grow accustomed to a certain dish and then I come in at a later date and it's gone. However, they make up for this by having something equally as good. For instance the last time I went they had a crab and waffle dish. It was really good, there was a spicy sauce that was a nice balance between sweet and savory. It does look like some of their starters are always on the menu, the pecan sticky buns for instance. Those are delicious and I really enjoy the BDT fries (they're like square hashbrowns). Honorable mention for the Brussels sprouts. I have to give credit to the BDT because I did not like Brussels sprouts until I tried theirs. Now, everytime I eat brussel sprouts i'm hoping they're comparable to BDT's. I have yet to try Blue Duck for their dinner, but if it's anything like their Brunch, then i'm sure it's fantastic as well.",Marquis P.
75,Atlanta,2018-05-01,Ef8Tk-IzYuSC7hl-LJ9Rzw,4, GA,"Have come here for brunch multiple times and there are some hits and misses. For starters, we had the crab cakes, which was very yummy, and I absolutely loved the homemade assorted pastries. The pastries are so fresh and delicious. I had the black sesame waffle for my entree and while the waffle itself was very good- crunchy and light at the same time, the passion fruit gelee that it came with was extremely sour. That was not a good pairing at all. The waffle has virtually no flavor if you don't dab it in maple syrup. It's not sweet enough that it needs an ultra sour passion fruit to balance it out. That was the only downside about this dish. The dukkah brittle, however, was very good. They could sell this as a stand alone item. My friend had the shrimp and grits and I tasted it. We make shrimp and grits far better in Georgia. The shrimp came with its head and it takes awhile to clean it off and take all the shrimp antennae out of the dish. The grits was not very good. After eating the crab cake and waffle, I was still very hungry and ordered a side of bacon and the cherry cobbler dessert. The dessert was very good! I noticed it takes quite awhile for food to come on the table. Overall very good but some dishes could be improved. Very prettily situated and lovely airy spaces.

Their bone marrow is a must and truly ""finger licking good""We went to BDT on Sunday brunch as they were award of Upscale Brunch of the Year 2016 and they do deserve such award. Brunch burger is flavorful and well balanced and fries are so difference than other restaurants that has crunchy/crispy outside and flavorful insides like mashed potatoes. I guess maybe they use duck fat frying so fries are so tasteful . We also ordered their pecan sticky buns which are super tasty with the perfect amount of sauce and pecans and sweet.  Besides food, BDT provides incredible service and delightful experience and we really had great time here and will definitely come back again for their other dishes.",Amy L.

For us, it was just...meh .",Jeana C.

84,Alexandria,2017-08-31,g1cBiB6chqwBlVFMmwH6AQ,4, VA,"Michelin star restaurant is checked off my list! Hallelujah!A couple friends and I decided to grab breakfast here before work. We made a reservation, and were quickly seated outside. The waiter brought out filtered water and asked for our drink orders. The menu is pretty extensive, which is impressive! It took me awhile to decide but I went with the jumbo crab scramble and the banana bread french toast. Both were amazing! The scramble was fresh and you can definitely taste it. I know their food is natural, organic and local so it was nice to know where the food is coming from and they they are sustainable. The French toast was my favorite. I saved it as my 'dessert' so I ate it afterwards but I soon regretted it since it was so good but I was too full to finish! I would 100% order that again. It was not overly sweet and it came with a side of this almond mousse that was so delectable. I will always remember it. All in all, this place had great service and great food. I would like to come back for lunch or dinner to try their heavier meals. This was my first Michelin star experience and it was a great way to kick it off!",Fii M.

87,Falls Church,2018-05-04,0_TkgRvNLBVxl8SLmDpL6Q,5, VA,"After hearing so many great things about this place, I decided to splurge for my birthday and get a reservation here. It was a little hard to find as it is under a hotel and the sign in front is not the biggest. We were seated immediately and our server brought us water as well.For drinks, I decided to order the Carry Me Away drink as the carrot ginger turmeric sounded interesting. It was pretty good, sweet and orangy, with a hint of spice to it and you can definitely see the turmeric coloring. We had to try to bone marrow, so we ordered that and it was just as great as I've heard. It was super fatty and very easy to spread on the bread. Plus the amount of herbs and salt they sprinkle on it really takes it to another dimension. For main entrees, we got the duck breast, the braised beef rib, and a side of the mushrooms. My duck was so soft with a layer of crispy skin and full of flavor. The braised beef rib was melt in your mouth soft. I also loved the mushrooms, which was salty and very garlicky, just the way I like them. It was actually a lot of food and we didn't have room for dessert, but since it was my birthday, they gave us a couple of free cookies. Not as great as ice cream, but enjoyable nonetheless. Overall, it was an extremely enjoyable experience, from the outstanding service to the excellent food, although it came with a hefty price tag. I would really like to come back and try their brunch though.",Ning Z.

One thing I would say is that they seem to have gotten slightly worse food wise for dinner. Their brunch and breakfast is one of the best you will find in DC. I feel their dinner meats are not as special anymore and their vegetable dishes were much better previously. Still one of my favorite places to eat for real good food. Don't expect too much from their meat dishes though.",Michael K.
89,Sydney,2018-04-22,w7j2bAUMbiG9YPTKy7Z8_g,2, Australia,"This place is overrated and not sure why it was awarded a Michelin star. The service was fine, but the food wasn't really that great. It seemed to try too hard and much of it was over seasoned. We went there based on all the reviews and the fact that it had a Michelin star, but was disappointed. We had the bone marrow, the foie gras creme brulee, the beef tartare, and the duck. The bone marrow was covered in some sort of graham cracker crumbs which overpowered the flavours of the bone marrow. The foie gras creme brulee was okay, but after a few bites again it became too sweet. The beef tartare was okay but nothing that was mouth watering.  The duck was overseasoned, we didn't even finish it. Overall, we were expecting more from a so-called Michelin starred restaurant. Wouldn't go again.",V T.
90,Boston,2017-07-18,AxkJNMJql5HweTxNY2_e6w,5, MA,"I've been here several times, each time when we stayed at the Park Hyatt, and enjoyed every single meal. My husband and I tried several of the breakfast items since it was included in our stay, and the grits, fries, and sweet breakfast dishes are my absolute favorite. We also celebrated Thanksgiving dinner at Blue Duck Tavern a couple years back and it was such a memorable experience. We started off with the buffet style appetizer course, where they had a large selection of meats, cheeses, vegetables, and raw items such as oysters. We then ordered a few entrees and sides for the table. We ended the night with my favorite course, dessert! There were traditional desserts such as apple pie and tarts as well as chocolate barks and cake pops. There were so many dessert options that I wanted to try them all, but ran out of stomach space by the end of the night!My latest visit was with a friend for breakfast. We shared the coconut macaroons waffles, chicken fried rabbit, and short rib hash. We both loved the waffles and only wished there was more of the toffee sauce to go with it!

92,Manhattan,2018-07-04,5q0f_XTDmMcaY9InkKxbYQ,2, NY,"This review is based on a 4th of July lunch (3rd visit overall including dinners). I hesitate to say whether I will return.Service: Disjointed - Waiter mistook orders. Main course was served before appetizers.  Value for money: $13 for fries (even if they were duck fat fried)! Although their meat dishes and certain appetizers are comparable to other fine dining establishments in the DMV area. Seating Fees: We were automatically charged a 20% service fee for a party of four and baby. I've seen this done at other cheeky restaurants in NYC but not so much in DC. Unproductive as we were likely to tip that amount anyway with a baby, and all goodwill has dissipated.Overall: The food remains very good and ambiance is special, but I think BDT is trending down. I hope my experience was an aberration and that they do truly deserve the Michelin one star they received.",Dairo I.
93,Washington,2017-12-10,vGyQc-NikV6dOGddZHZGlA,2, DC,"For a Michelin Star rated restaurant, I expected a significantly better culinary experience.  The service was fantastic and our waiter made some great wine and drink, as well as food, recommendations, but the execution of the food was less than stellar.  It was actually mediocre at best.  To walk you through my anniversary meal, we started off with the Crispy Pork Belly, which I will grade as a solid A dish, because the cabbage slaw and the ancho chili fermented squash added a nice acidic and spicy flavor to the crispy, melt in your mouth pork belly.  Cocktail wise, I had the Texas State Fair with Bourbon and a hint of bacon and popcorn.  I could definitely taste the sweet and savory and smoky hints of the bacon and popcorn, so I would definitely recommend this drink to any bourbon or dark liquor lover.  Entree wise was where the Tavern faltered.  My girlfriend's Skuna Bay Salmon was severely overcooked and unfortunately had a stale, fishy taste to it, which could not be covered up by the pinot noire glaze and the soggy, charred cauliflower wasn't a very good complement to the dish either.  Overall, a grade of a D in my opinion.My dish was the Braised Beef Rib, which I must say was extensively better than the salmon, but at the end of the day, it wasn't spectacular, which is what I expect from a Michelin Star kitchen.  The rib was large and tender, but it wasn't fall off the bone great and the chimichurri added some, but not a lot of flavor.  Overall, I would grade this a B.We also split the Beet Root Gnocchi, which was honestly pretty good and extremely flavorful, but when your entree side dish is the most memorable dish, then that is a problem.For dessert, we had the Butternut Squash Cake, which had a creamy, yet fruity coconut sorbet to complement it.  The curry roasted apples also gave it a bit of a nice savory flavor, which was unique, but made the dessert really stand out as something special, which I enjoyed.  Overall, I would grade the dessert as an A too.Overall, I would give Blue Duck a D+ in my book.  Really, I think that the food deserves an overall grade of a passing C, but the fact that this is a Michelin Star restaurant, means that the failure to blow my culinary mind out of the water, which is what I expect from Michelin Star restaurants, means that the disappointed brings my C and three star rating down to two.  I hope to be able to give Blue Duck another try in a couple months and hopefully remake this rating, but until then, I will be left disappointed.",Zach S.

Following that, we had the bone marrow, a dish I've heard only good things about from multiple people. My party unfortunately wasn't very impressed.

I've been to a lot of high-end restaurants before, but never one with several (3?) kitchens all spread throughout the restaurant, where you could see the phases of food prep right from your table. It feels very personal, like you are a small group of critics on a cooking show. The food cooking areas, prepping areas and plating areas (marble islands) are elegant as well, and you are free to walk through and observe on your way to the restroom. The dishes (Michelin 1-star), are of course, delicious and interesting. Service is IMPECCABLE. Couldn't be more accommodating and not snobby. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.",Scott L.

98,Arlington,2017-05-07,PGsfYPMqXLyo3Btr1XVYwQ,5, VA,"Dining at Blue Duck Tavern is an experience and one I will remember. It is located inside the Park Hyatt hotel, with a very sleek and minimalist design. We were greeted and seated immediately. We had reservations which is highly recommended. They were also recently awarded a Michelin star which may have added to the consistent crowd. For our food, we decided on a few plates from different parts of the menu to share. We started with bone marrow as our appetizer, duck breast and braised beef ribs are our entree, and duck fat fries and broccolini for our sides. At the recommendation of our server, my husband chose a French red wine to go with our meal. The wine paired well with the bone marrow and both protein choices, so we were pleased. They brought out some house bread which was good and freshly made; however we strategically did not eat much of the bread. I was there for the dishes we chose. The bone marrow was absolutely amazing. If you have never had bone marrow, I highly recommend that your first time be Blue Duck. They do a wonderful job highlighting flavors of the bone marrow and prepare it well. The duck breast and braised beef were delicious. The braised beef was practically falling apart and so good. The sides lovely as well. The broccolini was fresh and the duck fat fries are big, crispy, and delicious. We somehow managed to make room for dessert (go big or go home at this point), and we split the chocolate ganache. Excellent way to end our meal.Service was fantastic from start to finish. They use new plates for each course, cleared the table of crumbs, and made sure we never had an empty glass. This is definitely not an everyday meal for us but very glad we had the opportunity to dine here.",Karisa G.

The menu is simple yet the food is complex, flavorful and can tell chef pays close attention to detail. You must order the bone marrow appetizer. The bone marrow was buttery, perfectly seasoned  and melted in my. My meal was the duck breast which was perfectly cooked at medium and paired with outstanding orange sauce. It was not gamy at all. We also ordered the bone marrow fat mashed potatoes which was creamy, flavorful and paired well with the duck and steak. The wild mushroom side was pan seared and just melted in my mouth. After our meal i was extremely satisfied and just felt happy. It is a bit pricey but absolutely worth it! I'm coming back here for brunch.",Parisa M.
100,Arlington,2017-07-12,_9s2aqYRu1kp2k4T-E6Zsg,5, VA,"My cousin surprised me by taking me here for my birthday. IT WAS SO NICE. Hyper expensive so don't come if you're trying be cheap. The service and atmosphere are both really good (except the kitchen is open so you'll come out smelling like meat). Also don't be alarmed of the extremely giant and large door you have to walk through - it is the real door not as heavy as it looks to open (but still heavy). We waited for our table at the bar and the bartender recommended me this interesting drink with honey mustard (actually really good, would recommend). And at the table, our server recommended this spicy margarita and a softer chocolate tasting one (both were good, but I thought the honey mustard one was super unique). We didn't know how the menu worked because it's just a bunch of food in sections. Our I server kindly informed us that generally a table of two split an appetizer, two meats and a vegetable. Anything more would be too much. So we followed his recommendation (all of his recommendations) - bone marrow for appetizer, duck and braised ribs (they've been doing this for 11 years he explained) and asparagus. It was the perfect amount (it actually was kinda lot). I've never tried bone marrow before but I'm glad I tried it here - was yummy meaty butter on bread. I preferred the beef over the duck - the beef was super easy to chew and super flavorful. We shared a cheesecake for dessert...I don't really remember much of it but it was good (but probably not worth the amount we paid for). The service was super nice too. Our server kept folding our napkins every time we went to the bathroom and changed our plates after every meal. YOU REALLY PAY FOR THESE NICE THINGS. Would go again (but only if I had someone suuuuuper special I'd be willing to drop this much money for).",Aimee L.

103,Sterling,2018-04-30,tSsCYuu1G3xNKihTauHBYA,1, VA,"This was my first time at a Michelin star restaurant, so I had very high expectations, but I am totally disappointed when I came for lunch on a weekday. The other reviewers are right, who awards these stars?  It's under the Hyatt hotel and we were able to find street parking, but you can also valet for $12.  Everyone was nice, and service I felt was what I would expect from a high-end restaurant, but not much better or memorable as other places I've gone to at this price point.  We were there to celebrate a special occasion.We ordered the duck confit leg and the braised beef.  According to other Yelpers, it seemed like the best bet for lunch.  Utterly disappointed that they literally threw salt on it!  I am not a picky person, but I know when food is overly salted.  The beef was tender I'll give that to them, and smothered in salt, salt, salt.  Same with the duck leg confit.  We ordered the mushrooms on the side, which again smothered in salt, and totally unacceptable and not even eatable!  What kind of a Michelin star restaurant is this?? Was the chef having an off day?  Did we not get a good experience because it was lunch time??  I simply cannot understand the raving reviews on here.  I was quite upset, and didn't even bother going for the apple pie dessert that others were raving about either.  The tab came out to be $99 for 2 people, and we ordered 2 entrees, a side, and a glass of wine.  There are tons of other places in town where this money could have been better well spent. The concept is different and cool where there's an open kitchen and you can watch your food being made though.",Xuan H.
104,Washington,2017-12-07,uSqaoDlWceql01XSTPnhXw,5, DC,"It has been a while since I've been back to BDT, but their service and food has not changed - It is consistently strong and always a wonderful experience.I made a birthday brunch reservation for 4 and when we all arrived at our table, I noticed that they provided custom menus that read 'Happy Birthday ____!"". The service itself was lovely - while our food did take a while to come out (we ordered appetizers, entrees and dessert), our server provided us with extra complimentary bites to keep our hunger satiated. We were all extremely full by the end of the meal.We ordered:Pecan Sticky Buns - as recommended by a manager serving our tableShort Rib Hash (2)Hot-Fried Chicken BiscuitBDT Brunch Burger I don't remember the name of the drinks ordered, but they were nicely presented and one of them even had a rock candy stick to add additional sweetness, if desired.I was amused by the fact that all our main dishes had perfectly cooked sunny side eggs that coated our food in a golden deliciousness. The BDT fries are great in that they're very subtle and robust in size. My personal favorite was the moist, chicken biscuit paired with some nice coleslaw that cut through the richness.Even though we had brought some custom birthday desserts, our server also brought out a complimentary dessert! Again, the presentation was lovely and the dish consisted of raw figs and pistachios.It is clear to see why Blue Duck Tavern received a Michelin star and I look forward to holding more special occasions here.",Jennifer K.
105,Washington,2017-05-19,HdvEkO0_1zQXZ2c8AyPLew,5, DC,"Delicious food, great vibes...frankly, it's hard to get much better than Blue Duck Tavern!Let's be real--Blue Duck is a standout on Yelp, which is why I was inclined to check it out in the first place--but still, there's good reason why. Located inside the Park Hyatt Hotel in downtown DC, Blue Duck Tavern isn't your average hotel restaurant. Rather, patrons come from all over the metro DC area, and beyond, for a taste of Blue Duck Tavern's award-winning cuisine. It's the epitome of a what can be described as an ""upscale-casual, trendy, New American restaurant""...and, well, it's wonderful.While Blue Duck Tavern is known for serving a Michelin Star-winning Brunch, I enjoyed dinner at BTD, and it was fabulous! I ordered the Organic Chicken, and shared the Roasted Wild Mushrooms (poultry, meats and seafood generally come as is, and then you're encouraged to order and share sides). Umm, WOW...everything was just TO DIE FOR! I'm already a huge fan of roasted mushrooms, but I must say, those were the BEST MUSHROOMS I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!Dinner wasn't complete without dessert--so we opted to share Blue Duck Tavern's famous Apple Pie for two. It was AMAZING (and certainly enough for two)!! It might sound crazy, but my dinner at Blue Duck Tavern simply could not be any more delicious!One of Blue Duck Tavern's unique features is it's open kitchen--which we were lucky enough to be seated near. In fact, at one point during our dinner experience, the chef came out to personally tell us about one of the dishes we'd ordered. It was a great, personal touch to a superb dining experience. :) While the DC dining scene has quite a lot to offer, Blue Duck Tavern is one of those places I want to return to again and again. I'm sure brunch and lunch are also stellar here--and I'm looking forward to trying those eventually, too.If you're in the DC area, love food, and have yet to experience Blue Duck Tavern...seriously, what are you waiting for?!?P.S. If you're heart desires to dine at Blue Duck, but you didn't make a reservation--the bar (located near/in the hotel lobby) serves the full menu, as well.",Anna K.
106,Sandy Springs,2017-05-29,60UmNqsEKx6_z1ajZqBOGg,3, GA,"This review is for two separate dining experiences - one for brunch and one for the bar.We stayed at the Park Hyatt during our trip to DC and we always try to stay somewhere we can take advantage of a great hotel resturant and bar if possible. After reading so many wonderful reviews on BDT, I thought this would be perfect.Service during both visits was the same - not warm in the slightest. We felt as though we were an inconvenience both times by the majority of the staff. Both times we went through at least three or four different servers which I believe is how they function here vs having your typical sections of customers. We stopped in for pre-dinner drinks on our way out of the hotel and other than the service, the drinks were amazing. The Broken Patio Furniture is the PERFECT summer cocktail and I never drink gin! It was delightful and delicately balanced. They also serve pistachios which aren't your typical offering, but very good!On to brunch - we were able to be seated and served without a reservation, even though I tried to get reservations before flying in and could not because everything was taken. The resturant truly did not look that busy so I'm not sure the issue with the system. We ordered the BDT Benedict which was their version of a deconstructed Cuban with poached eggs and also the Spare Rib Hash which was so deep and rich in flavor. I'm not a huge horseradish fan, so the sauce on the bottom of the hash wasn't my favorite (nor do I believe the dish needed such a sauce), but I was able to eat around it and the hash was to die for! Both of these offerings were great, but I felt as though it was overpriced by at least 25% and we weren't paying for service because it was nonexistent. It was convenient for us because we were staying in the hotel, but there are tons of great options in Georgetown without paying for the name here.",Naomi H.
107,Central Oklahoma City,2017-10-25,LwKtg2QY5MtZCQvSUsRwgg,5, Oklahoma Cit,"5-Stars. Unqualified. The kind staff extended my reservation due to a late flight, even though they were full for the evening. So kind! Right when you arrive, the large door tells you that you are walking into an event bigger than you imagined. The ambience is lively, yet intimate. The warm colors and open kitchen buzz with calm. The bread service was on point. Amazing season-appropriate pumpkin butter. Great San Francisco style Epi Bread and a better than expected Cranberry Walnut bread. I chose the bone marrow for my starter and couldn't have been happier with my decision (though the ghost of the untasted Foie Gras still haunts me). The bone marrow was the best I've ever had (I've probably had it half a dozen other times in multiple different countries). It was inventive, yet perfectly classic (a beef cheek remoulade coated the top). I then moved on to the Braised Beef Rib. I order Beef rib pretty much any time it is available and this has been one of the top experiences of this dish I've ever had. Have it alone and it is hearty, tender and full of rich flavor. Add in the Chimmichuri that comes on top and your enter international waters of fresh yumminess. Brought over to pair with my Beef was a cheese grits dish which, as David my waiter suggested, would go nicely along - AND THEY DID! The base of the grain really helped cut through the weighty acid of the Beef. Wonderful pairing! My waiter, David, was top notch. Informative, personal, but above all professional. The beauty of this Michelin star restaurant is that the portions are huge, but the quality is even bigger. I've never left a restaurant of this caliber more stuffed and satisfied. Bravo!",David B.
108,Minneapolis,2017-04-26,53KeiCrCj400I4r11on-Fg,5, MN,"I have been coming here every trip to DC since 2009. I consider it to be one of the best contemporary American restaurants in the country and would argue it's the best restaurant that's an extension of a hotel I've ever been to in the US. On my most recent trip, I had the pork belly appetizer which was crispy crusted as advertised, tasty and perfectly cooked. I would order the bone marrow though if I were not on a low carb diet. For my entree, I had the short rib, which I've had on every visit. It is spectacular. I paired it with the mushroom side that was also excellent. Unless you don't like beef or mushrooms, you should order the short rib and mushrooms. You will not be disappointed. It says something that their menu constantly changes but they haven't taken their approach to braised short rib off in over 8 years!",Nima A.
109,Arlington,2017-11-17,xBo7vV4-a9Hco_WeuVxfxw,4, VA,"Enjoyed a wonderful experience here with my hubby for our recent anniversary. Blue Duck has been on my foodie bucket list for awhile now, and it certainly lived up to expectations. We had personalized Anniversary menus, which was a lovely touch and started things off on a high note. Though it weirded out the hubby at first, I insisted that we start with the infamous bone marrow and neither of us was disappointed. The marinated beef cheeks were a nice addition, but the buttery garlicky marrow was the star. Smeared on the toasted bread with a squeeze of lime...pure decadence. We opted for the duck breast and braised beef entrees, and both were perfectly done. Duck tends to be a bit gamey in general, so while the breast was cooked perfectly (medium rare), I found it a tad chewy. The leg, on the other hand, was absolutely delicious - meat fell right off the bone. The braised beef was tender, and the chimichurri sauce really elevated the flavor. We also ordered a side of the brussel sprouts, which is my-go restaurant veggie...these were delightfully crispy and included bacon - cannot go wrong. Hubby and I each enjoyed a glass of California Cabernet, which paired well with every dish. Though we were stuffed by this point, I felt the frozen banana parfait dessert sounded intriguing enough to try. It was beautifully plated, and we both liked the tempura coated marshmallows - but I do wish we had gone for the apple pie! Next time. Dessert was comped though, which was a super nice gesture. Service was impeccable from start to finish, and I appreciated that each course was well spaced out. It's a fine line between providing too much or too little time, but Blue Duck nailed it. I would also be remiss if I failed to mention the bread basket - ahhhmazing! The cranberry walnut bread paired with the light, fluffy, seasonal pumpkin butter is the stuff of dreams.",Audrey M.
110,Los Angeles,2018-03-05,D8-O6UdAGAXVE1VH3Fc8vw,5, CA,"WowSo been meaning to come here for a while, every guide book mentions this placeFinally made time while visiting and was blown alwayService started mediocre with the waiter disappearing for a bit while I waited for a bit, but only uphill from there!!Ordered the Sonoma County Cabernet snd the bone marrow which is to die for, maybe the best marrow I ever had.I followed it up with another glass of wine and the Pork Shank. The pork showed up cold. After I mentioned it to the waiter, they put in a new order and was juicy succulent and overall simply divine.When I asked the waiter about the desserts while drinking my espresso, I mentioned my disappointment in the large size of the Apple pie (says for 2 but it truly big enough for 4) as I was only one person, ended up with the custard. After I dug into the fresh custard, my server brought over a mini apple pie on the house. Thought to myself, fantastic service, thank you.He then polished me off with another glass of wine on the house. This has to be the best, right?WRONG!!when I requested the check, he told me they felt bad about the cold pork, and the ENTIRE meal was on the house. Ended up tipping him a bunch and noting my desire to return to Blue Duck Tavern in every future DC trip.A+5 starsEdit: I've already told half my friends, and I'm still in the taxi leaving.

111,Washington,2017-10-13,3aTk3UFiZcgOwsREI4Pnog,5, DC,"I planned far in advance to treat my husband to dinner at Blue Duck Tavern for his birthday and it was a fabulous experience! From being welcomed at the host stand, to the personalized ""happy birthday bryan"" menu (nice keepsake too), to the service and recommendations and hospitality-just absolutely what I'd expect of a Michelin-star restaurant!We took the metro here as it is relatively close to foggy bottom. We had 7:45pm reservations on a Friday (again, made far in advance) and were immediately welcomed at sat at a table in the main dining room. The cocktails all sounded interesting but I chose the All Inclusive(R(h)um, Roasted Apple, Pineapple, Sage) and my husband had Texas State Fair (Bourbon, Popcorn, Caramel, Bacon). We both loved the table bread-especially the cranberry walnut! The pumpkin butter was delicious and seasonal. We were first served a complimentary appetizer-the endive salad with tea-smoked duck breast, pistachio gremolata, jasmine tea jelly, and lemon-pickled turnip. The duck was perfectly medium rare and I loved the smokiness which also seasoned the endive lettuce. All of the flavors complemented each other well, although, honestly, I would not have paid $17 for it as priced. It was a nice touch for the birthday celebration though.My husband ordered the braised beef rib with rosemary-roasted sunchoke and pickled fresno chimichurri. The beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender and the flavor profile was so complex and unique. I ordered the Moulard duck breast with tomato-orange marmalade. This was my all-time favorite duck dish! Tender, perfectly medium rare duck, not too fatty and just enough carmelization on the skin, and just so flavorful! We also ordered a shareable side-the white cheddar grits. I really enjoyed the smoky flavor profile and the creaminess. They were not too cheesy but it ended up being perfect. The portion size was perfect for sharing. We also received a complimentary dessert -it was sweet and possibly was the butternut squash cake from looking at their menu.This was an absolutely exquisite dining experience! We felt welcomed and special throughout the meal and had several people wish my husband a happy birthday. I would 100% recommend anyone searching for a ""special occasion"" restaurant to consider Blue Duck Tavern as hospitality + amazing food is what we got here and nothing gets better than that!",Laura W.
112,Washington,2017-06-06,aHHQAluHCO6NFa73B7OvVA,3, DC,"The review is based on two visits: brunch and lunch. It's more of a 3.5 stars (between ""A-OK"" and ""Yay, I'm a fan"")How do I start... well, let's say, I'm not sure if this is really a Michelin 1 star restaurant...Service for brunch was definitely not up there for Michelin standard. It was good, but not great. Lunch was better. Again, is it up there like many other Michelin restaurants? Not really based on my experiences.Food was good, but not ""wow, I'm blown away. This is outstanding. I need and want this everyday!"" A few dishes we ordered and enjoyed: for brunch, smoked salmon, crab cake, BDT Benedict. for lunch: duck confit leg, and pear salad (i don't think it's on the menu anymore). As for the bone marrow that many people order and enjoy, it isn't really my thing anymore, so I didn't order it... One thing for sure about the food is that they are definitely IG worthy.",Joy D.
113,Washington,2017-03-22,btiDEJwbkEOP-ybfdft8qQ,4, DC,"The concept of this restaurant is fresh ingredients from regional farms & ranches, cooked in wood burning kitchen. Essentially, they'll list which farm your meals'll be coming from. They do have different menu for breakfast, lunch, dinner and seasonal as well. It's a pretty famous and often packed place, I'd suggest getting a reservation. Braised Beef Short Rib ($32) - Pretty enjoyable dish. The beef was done very well as they just melt off the bone. The sauce's good, but there's nothing unique/different about it. Portion size was acceptable as well.Overall - The food here are quite simple, but they were done nicely. The food's solid, don't get wrong. However, I was shocked to find out that this place got a Michelin star.",Robert C.
114,Sunnyvale,2017-03-21,jr1Nml7Uz7HNmTuY_IPrWQ,5, CA,"This is one of my favorite restaurants of all time. This place is clean, service is on point with professional coat-type uniform, menu is organized with ingredients being fresh, unique, and full of flavors. I also like how the kitchen is open-faced; people can walk by and observe cooks prepping food and cooking. I love the window seating with lots of lighting, the glass cubed seating, dessert prep at the kitchen, etc. This whole place is spotless and has great ventilation. My friend and I started with oven-roasted bone marrow from KS ($20). I loved rubbing the roasted garlic on the toast while spreading the creamy bone marrow. It was out of this world and by far the best bone marrow dish I've had to this date. I then ordered fried chicken quail ($30) with that fresh Koji marinade & honey garlic sauce. It was delicious. They served about four pieces of quail in which was crispy and sweet with a little spicy tang.My friend ordered the duck confit leg ($24) from NY. It was oven roasted and this made the meat tender and soft which melted off the bone like butter. The cranberry sauce was sweet and had a tang in it but paired great with the duck.For dessert, we shared their popular apple pie. This was unique because it looked like a stuffed big quiche or a pot-pie. The top crust is glazed in this sweet honey with brown sugar. The apples were tarty and baked to perfection. For $19 this is a steal and well worth it.",Allister D.
115,Washington Navy Yard,2018-05-29,-t34k6DIV0U9Ofov9z-gHw,4, Washingto,"Seeing the reviews I just had to post. This is one of my favorite restaurants in the DC area. The service is excellent, if a bit casual. The food is delightful, fresh, simple and perfectly executed. The tea menu is the only of its kind in the city. I have eaten there perhaps 5-6 times and have always been delighted. My only complaint is it being difficult to get a reservation!",Evelyn T.
116,Arlington,2018-04-03,Zmk8Ym8ARuSd2nnms4l-Hw,5, VA,The food and cocktails here are phenomenal. I came here with my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary and we had a great time. We got oysters for an appetizer which were great. I got the crispy octopus as my entree and my girlfriend got the duck. Both of them were great and the duck meat was cooked perfectly. I'll need to come back to try the apple pie but we didn't save enough room for it and were too full.,Rob H.

It's definitely a classy atmosphere. They have great drinks for brunch - different flavored sorbet mimosas. The sorbet was amazing! Great flavor!The crispy brussel sprouts with lemon - awesome. I'd actually never had brussel sprouts with lemon, but I loved this so much that I started making my brussel sprouts at home with lemon. Husband's chicken biscuit was juicy - great preparation on the chicken. My short rib hash was the best! I would gladly return to spend my money here again. Well worth it.",Acelyn B.
119,Lake Ridge,2017-10-20,LFWX09kwKh0U6wER_dK_iw,4, VA,"I came to BDT for my girlfriends birthday dinner.  This is our first michelin starred restaraunt and we were very excited to try it. You can try and find parking but we used valet. The ambiance of the place was great and the service was great as well. Now for the food. We started with the Bone Marrow and it was unbelievable. Please, please, please make sure you order the bone marrow.  It is delicious. We both ordered the duck which was delicious as well.  Perfectly cooked and very tender and moist. The risotto was not bad and the scallops were alright (also very expensive for only 3 scallops). We also ordered the 'fries' which were essentially big, fat rectangles. Interesting take on fries but the taste was ok.Overall I would highly reccomend this place. Highly!",Michel R.
120,Washington,2017-09-23,Fnzc4eBRGMYg-uGLVguCAQ,5, DC,"Blue Duck Tavern was my first Michelin star experience and all I can say is WOW!! The ambiance was classy and the food was outstanding.I would highly recommend making reservations two weeks in advance as this restaurant gets fully booked long in advance. Although I will say most people probably opt for later dining times from what I witnessed so you will probably have better luck booking earlier times. I was a bit concerned about the dress code prior to coming. I am here to report that the dress code is very lenient, I would recommend going in business casual but I saw many patrons who were dressed much more casual than my definition of bus casual. Lastly, Blue Duck customers are able to take advantage of the $12 valet parking fee which Alexis and I partook in as the street parking is very limited. Now onto the most important part of the review... the food....Alexis and I both started off with a drink- Broken Patio Furniture and the Sancho's Boy. I really enjoyed the Broken Patio Furniture as it had a light and refreshing taste and didn't take away from the taste of the food. We ordered the Marinated Octopus for an appetizer which was a unique dish if I may say. This dish comes with curried popcorn, cauliflower and 4-5 pieces of octopus. The octopus was fresh and was seasoned well and I enjoyed the curry flavor of this dish. For our main entrees I opted for their staple Moulard Duck Breast and Alexis opted for the Confit Lamb Loin. This was hands down the best duck I have ever had in my life. The duck was cooked to a medium rare- medium temperature. The meat itself was so juicy/tender and the thin layer of fat provided a nice crunch with every bite of the duck. I throughly enjoyed every bite of my duck and was quite sad when I ate my last piece. Lastly for dessert we opted for the Peach pie. On the menu, its recommended to be shared with two. This pie can easily be shared with 4, as Alexis and I had to-go the last two remaining slices. I don't even know how they can bake their pies to be so good. The peach pie was the best I have ever had and I am glad I was able to try it out before they switch back to the Apple Pie as peach season is over now. The pie also comes with a cup of homemade ice cream and that excellent. Overall, I had a very positive experience here. My favorite dish was hands down the duck breast tied closely with the peach pie. Our waiter David was very professional as he took the time to explain the menu to us and checked up on us during our dining experience here. I highly recommend dining at Blue Duck Tavern as you will not be disappointed. I'm looking forward to the next time I dine here. P.S. If you let the staff know ahead of time they can customize the menu for special occasions and will decorate the dessert for you.",Will C.
121,Fells Point,2017-11-26,pq_X7HYLvp9g5E9lZM68qA,2, Baltimor,"Visit 1: I don't make too many trips out to DC, so when I go I try to do my research. Blue Duck seemed like a safe (but pricey!) bet, based on its huge Yelp following. My friends and I gave the menu a cursory look, liked what we saw, and hoofed it out for morning brunch. I mean, they have a ~*Michelin star*~Blue Duck is a bright and airy place, which exudes the refined and expensive vibes of a modern art gallery. There's a semi-exposed kitchen and tons of white-clad chefs buzzing around like worker bees. There's also a gorgeous marble island in the kitchen with waterfall countertops (I'm an unabashed kitchen design nut, so this place got my heart all aflutter). The creme brûlée waffles were calling my name the whole drive down and I was so hyped to tuck into them. Were they good? Heck yeah. Were they worth the $19/Michelin star? Eh... But in a fantastical world where I can pop $19 waffles on the reg, I would make these a habit. The waffle batter was aight, but each square divot was occupied with vanilla bean custard and a burnt caramel crust. The entire getup was garnished with plump, poached peach slices and basil. (You only got 3 peach wedges, though!). It was a genius way to get creme brûlée to pass as breakfast food. I was sold.My friends, however, were not so enthused. I recall them getting a rather sad pork belly sandwich and a thoroughly depressed-looking BDT omelette. Think a grey cocoon-like tube of egg laying askew on an ungarnished plate. I wish I had the photos on hand. We got a good laugh out of the omelette (before the bill came, of course).Visit 2: a family member was staying at the Hyatt for a conference so, while I would have been more inclined to hit up another DC brunch spot, Blue Duck was just too darn convenient. By this time the peach brûlée waffles had been swapped out for their chai spiced kin, so I figured these would be worth another $19 gander (insert money fluttering away emoji). I also got a strawberry sorbet mimosa with a dainty rock sugar wand ($12) because gosh darn it, I was going all in. The mimosa was pleasant and I was a huge fan of the lil wand, but sadly the waffles were a large step down from the previous. These guys were a lot drier and a tad cool in the centre. The chai flavouring was not really discernible and the bourbon squash mousse and elysium gastriuque were... honestly, I would have been much happier with the peaches and basil. My dining companion is practically a goat and will eat anything masticable, so I did not have them weigh in on my minor waffle crisis. All in all, I've spent over $50 at Blue Duck brunch in the past year and don't have really much to show for it? Maybe I'm doing this wrong? (Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results?). Mayhaps their dinner or lunch fare lives up to their star. Until then, I'd probably come back to swoon over the kitchen design and sip mimosas.",Halley D.
122,Tuscaloosa,2018-04-16,cmnq7DcaYhmW-GBfzODmYg,5, AL,I don't know how this place would get less than 5 stars from everyone. The greeters at the door were absolutely lovely. My waiter was very friendly. Food came out quickly. I had the duck confit that was simply epic! Also I had a cocktail that I can easily say was one of the best cocktails I ever had... it was called the green thing! The place is beautiful. Would definitely come again!,Faye K.

124,Annapolis,2017-02-28,vc7SYcMr0unumVcRD87INA,5, MD,"After reading all of the reviews about BDT, I was anxious to see if it really was as good as they say. Well, IT IS! Everything was great from start to finish. The restaurant itself is much larger than I originally anticipated. We were seated a lovely table near the window. Our server was very nice and was able to answer any questions we had about the menu. She was also very knowledgable about the wine selection and made some great recommendations. For our appetizers, we decided to try the bone marrow and the beet salad. Having tried bone marrow many times before, I was very impressed with the flavor and presentation of this appetizer. For our entrees, I went with the strip steak ""off the menu"" special and my husband ordered the pepper crusted tuna. Everything was delicious! My steak was cooked to medium perfection! For sides, we ordered the white corn grits, the sweet and sour baby turnips, and our server surprised up and ordered the BDT fries for us. Our favorite side was definitely the grits - they provided just the right amount of ""comfort food"" vibe for our meal. For dessert, we shared the apple pie for 2. This place definitely deserves the Michelin star it has received. Is it a little pricy? Yes, but that is expected. I would love to come back and sit outside on the huge patio when the weather allows :) Great food/drink/wine selection, amazing service, and awesome ambience!",Laura M.

I would come back but not a must try in DC. The reason I gave the restaurant 4/5 is because even though it's good, I was not amazed by the food, I had high expectations for a Michelin 1 Star.

126,Fairfax,2017-02-27,3anV7WG9OV060D0Lu6cLyg,5, VA,"I had an amazing first experience at Blue Duck Tavern. My boyfriend and I came here for a very belated Valentines dinner and they took really good care of us, not to mention the food was phenomenal. We ordered the bone marrow to start, which was amazing. Bone marrow is very rich but the herb and garlic crust really balanced the dish out. It was also generously portioned, the bones were much larger than I expected!For entrees, my boyfriend and I ordered the duck breast and short rib with a side of crispy brussel sprouts. Everything was delicious. I especially loved the duck, it was tender, well seasoned and came with a great jam-like sauce that really brought out the flavor. The waitress even threw in complimentary hand cut fries, these things were huge! Lastly, we got the apple pie for 2 for dessert. Also extremely tasty, perfectly flaky and not too sweet. Our waitress again went above and beyond and gave us her favorite dessert, the Caramelia Bavarian, for us to try as well as a side of vanilla ice cream to go with our pie. Seriously, she was the best and really made our dinner feel special. I am definitely coming back as soon as I can to try their other menu items. I love the open kitchen, it was pretty cool that we got to sit near the kitchen to see how they operate and plate each dish. You can tell they have a lot of pride in getting the details right. The prices are also very reasonable, especially for a Michelin starred establishment. Our meal (1 app, 2 entrees, 1 side, 1 dessert) came out to be about $140 including tip/tax.",Rachel Z.

It's upscale, ritzy with swank, cool decor but not stuffy........And, most of all its garnered with accolades ranging from Zagat's America's Top Restaurants to Washingtonian Magazine and the coveted Bon Apetit Food Innovators Award.I had this place on my radar for some time now and I figured what better way to experience it, by making it my dining place of choice for Valentine's Day. Let me first say this.....Blue Duck Tavern did not disappoint!  The dining experience from beginning to end was impeccable and made dinner a really special one for me and my date.  The hostess led us to our table, which had a great view of the open kitchen, as I'd requested when making the reservation. I was surprise to see that they actually read my request in the special comments section.  Talk about being detailed....Brownie-Point Check #1.Our server soon introduced herself and offered menus.  This is where the drool began.  There were so many choices of great small plates and shareable eats to choose from.  So, instead of wasting time, we dived in on a couple of plates to share.  We both decided on:APPETIZERS*  OVEN ROASTED BONE MARROW -- Wow!....That's really all I can say about this dish.  I've never seen marrow served this way.  Our server informed us that it was a calf femur bone; roasted in garlic spiced pumpkin butter.  The butter spread on the crunchy-chewy french bread was truly one of the best things I've ever tasted. Highly recommend it. *  SWEET POTATO TART -- This was very good, but too sweet to be eaten as an appetizer in my opinion.  I saw it more as a dessert, but trust there were no complaints.  My date and I was practically finger-fighting over the remaining tart filling and crumbs.MAIN COURSE*  BRAISED BEEF RIB w/ HOUSE MADE STEAK SAUCE -- Every man and steak lover's dream.  A winner in my book.  The braised beef rib was so tender, juicy and of great flavor.*  SUCKLING PIG -- Succulent and moist, with delicious jus and baby vegetables served on side really completed this dish. And, the crispy pork rind (skin) was to die for....my favorite part!*  VEAL SWEET BREAD w/ TRUFFLE MAC & CHEESE -- The winner of the night in my book!  The veal sweet breads, coupled with aged cheddar mac n' cheese and Truffle mushrooms...made for a serious foodie delight and masterful dish. The pairing of flavors were outstanding. DESSERT*  STRAWBERRY RHUBARB COBBLER -- My second favorite dish of the night!  Our server described this dessert as a ""foodgasm"" and she was not wrong!  The strawberry rhubarb cobbler, served with buttermilk biscuits took me back my childhood and lazy summer days of picking and eating fresh berry cobblers with dumplings made with love by Grandmother.  A cathartic moment for sure.  My mouth is watering just thinking about this dish, as I write this review.  It had the perfect balance of sweet vs. tart.In all, a foodie's paradise and great dining experience from beginning to end.  What comes out of the kitchen is pure genius.  The chefs are undoubtedly a talented team.  There was not one dish that we did not like.  Everything was so fresh, made with farm to plate ingredients and it shows not only in taste --but in presentation too.  The service staff was outstanding as well. If you are in need of place to celebrate that special occasion, milestone or even silent that inner ""glutton beast"" in your stomach yearning for something different or masterful american eats.....then look no further.  You will find it all here!Thank you Blue Duck Tavern for making my vday dinner date one to remember!",DON C.

We actually enjoyed it more than we expected. We got there fifteen minutes early from the reservation and they had us waiting in the lobby till it was our reservation time. Our server was very nice and proper. She gave us good suggestions and made sure we knew what we were ordering. We ended up ordering an appetizer, two sides one entree for each and dessert. We loved the idea that their menus constantly change seasonally to serve what's fresh.  We were told that they pick their own veggies and they were crispy and fresh. I'm so glad we finally got to try this place, definitely will be back to try other things on the menu .If you are in the mood to try something special , this is the place to go!",Star K.
129,Atlanta,2017-03-14,4W5-nkLLLrkdBerc5iFC7A,4, GA,"Went there with old friends from grad school. The restaurant is located in the Park Hyatt hotel. The decor looks very nice and upscale. We ordered the following items:Bone marrow: pretty good, but aren't all the bone narrow the same? I've had bone marrows at other nice restaurants, and they all tasted good. So I don't really understand the hype here.Roasted duck with cranberry and mustard seed: this might be the star of the meal. The duck leg quarter was cooked to perfection! The meat was tender, juicy, bursts with flavors! I ordered this dish and shared it with my friends, and they both really like it.Pork chop: I tried one slice, and it was good, but nothing to write home aboutChicken fried quail: the sauce they put on it was sweet and sour, but I personally like savory quail so this dish didn't do it for me.Hand cut fries: these fries were good!! Must try! It's crispy on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside.Sweet and sour Turnips: it tasted like picked turnips , kinda refreshing when you're eating so much meat.Overall, I had a good time catching up with old friends, and the food was good. The only reason why I took off one star is because of the service. Our waiter was not very good. Had to wave him down so many times, and he just gave out this vibe that he doesn't wanna be there.",Joyce L.
130,Arlington,2017-11-25,KlHYYZvKO0BSXHFiYZ8eEA,3, VA,"Wanted to try the bone marrow that people raved about and managed to get a last minute brunch reservation for a birthday celebration. The bone marrow was flavorful and rich - worth the money and lived up to its reputation. However, my main dish was a sandwich of sodium overload - the spicy fried chicken sandwich. The chicken breading and coating sauce was super salty than spicy and the slaw tasted as if it was tossed in salt and more salt!! I'm not a picky eater, but it was impossible not to pick through everything just so I can eat something, and the strand of hair I found embedded in the breading definitely decrease my appetite even more. My main dish became the bare chicken and egg with biscuit sandwich. Our other dish was the short rib hash. I didn't even bother trying it but fiancé said it was superb and I'll just take his words on that.We were full after the main course and decided to get a lighter dessert somewhere else but the waiter was kind enough to give us a squash cake(?) in celebration of my fiancé's birthday.The overall dining experience and service were great but the food quality was not what I expected from a 1 Michelin Star restaurant. Maybe less effort is put into brunch foods... Not sure I would be returning anytime soon.",Joann G.

133,Washington,2017-04-24,EBVL0XA_RTc1cjjHk9dvUw,4, DC,"Thoroughly enjoyed my brunch at Blue Duck.First let me remark on the space.  The layout really lends itself to brunch on a nice day - lots of natural light in an open, spacious dining area.  The food is prepared in a space that flows seamlessly into the dining area; very cool to watch it being prepared.Service was friendly and efficient.  Water was promptly refilled when needed, and I cannot understate how much value I place on this in a dining experience.  One item of note is they have separate food runners from actual servers.  While the server is usually not far behind, there was an awkward moment or two when the food runner provided our food and we were left wondering if anyone was going to explain it to us.Now for the food.  The Roasted Bone Marrow was PHENOMENAL.  So rich and creamy, with the perfect seasonings on top.  Garlic cloves on the side were an ingenious idea.  The bones have deep cavities, providing ample marrow in each.  There's nothing worse than a skinny, over-cooked bone that you're left trying to aggressively scrape the marrow out of.  One of the best marrow dishes I've ever tried.  But what is it with restaurants never providing enough toast with these types of dishes?  Whether it be bone marrow, foie gras, or paté, please provide enough toast so I don't have to lather the stuff on every square centimeter.Pecan Sticky Buns.  Another big winner.  Pecans were fresh and the dish was not nearly as sweet as you'd expect it to be.  Light yet packed with flavor - perfect placement as a starter instead of a desert.Crab Cakes.  Some of the better crab cakes I've had in the area.  Lots of fresh, flaky crab meat with very few fillers.  Loved the celery root puree it came with.  I think I prefer mine hot and slightly crispy on the edges, which these weren't, but it didn't detract from anything.  I don't regret ordering them, but for $16 apiece, I'll probably pass next time.Short Rib Hash.  I had my mind made up for awhile that this would be my main course.  It wasn't bad, just wasn't what I hyped it up to be in my head.  I like that the short rib had a sweet tang to it.  Didn't like that the meat was cut up into little cubes.  Also I wish the egg yolk was more runny.  Comes with two big biscuits.  Honestly, maybe I was getting a bit full at that point, which may have affected my judgment.  Again, not bad, but I'd try something different next time.Mixed Berry-Banana Organic Yogurt Smoothie.  I generally don't like banana, so I asked if they could do mixed berry only.  They said it's pre-made, so that wouldn't be possible.  That was pretty surprising given the stature of this place, but I went ahead & ordered it anyways.  It was good, but $10 for a half glass?  Overall, very satisfied.  Even with so many good brunch options in the city, this place has earned its reputation (and Michelin star).  For the price-conscious, it's probably preferable to find an unlimited food/drink spot, but here, you get what you pay for.  I just wish my favorite two dishes weren't the first two.  Regardless, I look forward to my next meal at Blue Duck!  I'll be dreaming about that bone marrow in the mean time....",Adam G.

The worst dishes were cauliflower (limp and mushy) and a relatively straightforward soup.Service/Atmosphere: service professional and nice.  Ambiance is on the fancier side.",Michael K.

We had a lovely waiter who helped us out all night. We got the charcuterie and cheese platter to snack on with our wine, and then I got the braised short rib entree. By the time I got my entree, I was already pretty stuffed, so keep that in mind when you decide to get the charcuterie and cheese appetizer! It's huge-and delicious of course. The braised ribs were also yummy, but it could use more vegetables because the meat was striated and needed a texture change.I also really wanted to try the apple pie, but it wasn't available so we got the peach pie instead. It was pretty good but nothing amazing. I heard lots of good things about the apple pie though, so that will have to wait for me! I do love that you can see the smaller ""kitchen"" out in the open. The bathrooms are also A class. It's probably part of the hotel rather than the restaurant, but still. Definitely adding this to the rotation and it's a plus that it has a Michelin star!",Aileen K.
137,Fairfax,2017-10-20,5bG0xC8IcUzON43GvvUIzg,4, VA,"This review is for the breakfast at Blue Duck Tavern.  The atmosphere and staff were fantastic.  I had the french press coffee (very good) and the Hot-Fried Chicken Biscuit.  It comes with a house cole-slaw.  While I asked for it on the side, it paired well with the chicken and egg.  The egg was cooked perfectly.  My only regret is that I didn't go for dinner.  I'll have to go back again to enjoy one of DC's only Michelin-rated restaurants.",Bobby K.

Please Note: people overlook but really have to try Blue Duck's fresh made ice cream.  My first visit there they had a ""homemade"" peanut butter ice cream, with chopped peanuts to add texture.  So good, I had to order a 2nd to-go since I KNEW I would be craving it again in a day or two.  Bingo, I was right. It wasn't as perfect at home as it sat a day in the freezer, but still so worth it.  I now order their icecream after every dinner, even though I rarely order dessert elsewhere.",Erika G.
139,Waldorf,2017-10-26,9hUPH9t0DcD4IEAGdQXa1g,3, MD,"The food was deliciously seasoned, but the service was sub par and we received cold food. I mean COLD to the point the little pans the food came in were also cold. We tried the beef tartar, the duck, the butchers cut (NY strip), Brussels sprouts and the butternut squash. The tartar was delicious and well balanced. Perfection. The duck and the NY strip were very well seasoned and cooked well. However, both dishes and the butternut squash side came out COLD. And yes, we didn't ask them to re-fire the dishes (bad on us) but we had 9PM reservations and we just didn't wanna wait another hour for dinner--it was 10PM already. I really wanted to like this place, but the service we received makes it hard to recommend to others... maybe we'll give it another try... maybe... At this price point and with the Michelin Star and all, I'm just so disappointed",Elisa P.

The sesame waffle was an odd dish, the passion fruit on it was sour and there was some unknown ingredient that tasted like wood (no other way to describe it). Plus it had crunchy sesame candy bits on it.!very strange. This is a typical hotel restaurant, the prices are high for what you get. They never refilled my coffee after asking.

On my last visit the asparagus was delectable, the meat fell (just enough) off the bone, and the cocktails were life changing. Last night...the meat was dry and uninspiring, the cocktails were boring at best (one tasted like strong medicine), and the vegetables were bland - frozen Trader Joe's style. Worst of all, no apology or recompense for not even having the drink we ordered from the menu. For a $130 tab, one expects better - much, much better.",D B.

147,Springfield,2017-01-13,OBAE4-OZiHgaQARadXzieA,5, VA,"My husband & I came here on my birthday and everything from the service to the food was above 5 stars. The service was beyond magnificent. We were greeted right away and our server was more knowledgeable than any server I have ever encountered. He was very professional and was able to describe every dish we asked about without even blinking an eye. My husband started off with a beer, but I started off with a glass of the St. Claire Chablis (must try). We also ordered their soup of the day, the oysters on the half shell, and the baby gem lettuce. To be honest I have no clue what kind of soup it was because when he was describing it I was tasting my wine and I overwhelmed with the refreshing taste. I must say though that the soup was on point and so incredibly delicious. The oysters were fresh and served with a house made vinegar and shallots. The vinegar was a great mix with the oysters. The baby gem lettuce was a very generous portion and paired very well with all of the ingredients. For our main course we ordered the duck and the braised beef. For sides we got the BDT fries, brussels sprouts, and escarole with beans. I just want to mention that if you come here and dont get the duck you should be ashamed. The duck was out of this world. It was cooked to perfection and paired with a cranberry mostarda...OH EM GEE! The braised beef was also pretty incredible. So tender and the flavor was on point. The BDT fries are idao-mazing. They are so thick and crunchy on the outside, but the inside is so soft. They serve it with a spicy mayo type of sauce and oh gosh so good. Both the escarole and the brussels sprouts were good, but if I had to pick a favorite it would have been the brussels sprouts. Hands down the best brussels sprouts I have ever had. So crispy and so full of flavor. To finish off this meal we got the key lime pie and the chocolate croissant bread pudding. The key lime pie was different than your typical key lime pie and made with a shortbread crust instead of a graham cracker crust, but very yummy. The chocolate croissant bread pudding was incredible. The chocolate with the crunch of the croissant...I could have eaten 5 of them!",Ashley O.

I was about 3-4 miles out and it was 1:45pm when I called them. The women who answered the phone said they were fully commited and brunch ended at 2:30 but I thought I'd still try my luck. Found a quick parking spot, walked in and was told the communal tables and bar area are first come first serve. I found a seat at the bar and managed to order before brunch ended. I settled on a glass of champagne and the short rib hash, fried egg and biscuit. I probably should've read the menu and seen that there was a little horseradish on the bottom of the dish so I tried to avoid it but other than that it was amazing. The bartender was friendly and service was exceptional as always. Glad I didn't listen to the lady on the phone and once again a wonderful dining experience at Blue Duck Tavern!

150,Washington,2017-03-24,nv-Q6PGeLV2NevTICF-iZg,4, DC,"Fantastic cocktails (and mocktails) as well as great food (especially small plates) in a very swanky lounge setting. The price matches the quality though with small plates and drinks at the $15-20 and entrees at $20-30+.My wife and I came here for a light dinner and drinks on a Sunday night and while the food and drinks were great, the price matched the quality, so it's hard to give it straight-up 5 stars. We got the crispy brussel sprouts, roasted wild mushrooms, and nantucket bay scallop crudo. The scallops were fantastic if a quite small plate. Simple with a nice sauce and a small potato latke that wasn't big enough to note and a bit overdone. Still, yummy.The vegetarian dishes (brussel sprouts and mushrooms) were both amazing and the stand outs of the meal for me. They were both a good size despite being the cheaper choices and perfectly cooked. The mushrooms were perhaps a tad over salted, but otherwise amazing with rich, buttery garlic flavors and the perfect cooked mushroom texture. The crispy brussel sprouts were perfectly cooked and came with a hummus-like dip under them that went surprisingly well.The drinks didn't disappoint either. I got a Fancy Tea (whiskey with lapsang souchong smoked tea ) that was different and delicious, but I _love_ smokey liquor and smokey tea, so it was made for me. My wife got a ginger-beer-based mocktail that was exceptional as well.The chocolate ganache dessert wasn't as stand-out as the drinks, mushrooms, or brussel sprouts, but didn't disappoint either.",Colin D.

152,Raleigh,2018-07-13,_uGEvsgKfljXH5NoO1IbkA,3, NC,"We stayed at the Park Hyatt DC and decided to check out the acclaimed Blue Duck Tavern. A young lady from our hotel gave it very good reviews so decided we check it out. First of all, from the hotel it is hard to determine where to go to get seated. It was obvious we didnt know where we were going and no one asked us if we needed help w anything. I had to ask someone where the host stand was. Since we didn't have reservations, we sat at bar table. We ordered drinks an app and our dinner and within a couple of minutes our app was at the table. My husband I both eat fast so we appreciate when a restaurant spaces out courses, but a minute or to after we finished our app, our entrees were on the table. This is supposed to be fine dining and did not like being rushed. The service was also not great. I asked our server about some of the dishes and just seemed like he was not enthused about taking to us about the menu. No one came to check on us after we got our entrees. Had to flag someone else to get us a glass of wine. The food was good but for a Michelin star restaurant I expected a lot more. I would give the food 4 stars and service 3 stars.",Carmen R.

When I arrived I was happy to find street parking right out front. I was worried that I would be late. But I was actually early. When I arrived it was a busy host stand but that dissolved quickly. I was seated near the open kitchen and it was fun to look at sometimes. But it really wasn't that big of a thrill. Didn't order any apps just beef ribs and the crispy Brussels which were amazing. My waiter was good. He comped a few dishes. It was a nice touch. Please note that the pastry portion of the kitchen is right when you walk in. I was literally in awe and completely nosey when looking at the baked goods. In all honesty I would go back again. I tended to like the sides more than the meats. Plus those portions were worth it.

Because in my opinion, the mood sets the tone for a dinner. The outside seating is great on a summer night, but the lighting isn't the best.

161,Rockville,2017-06-02,-_IoxMAS5eCs_wz8ZyiK6g,4, MD,"Honestly I don't think Blue Duck Tavern really should have a Michelin one star rating. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and experience, but it didn't wow me like some other restaurants, which did not have any stars.The door to the restaurant is the opposite of grand, in fact I'm sure most people walk past it the first time around. The look and atmosphere of the restaurant are clean and sleek, but not necessarily welcoming. Also, the AC was blasting right behind us. The menu itself is pretty innovative and intriguing, but pretty expensive. I guess we expected that.We ordered 6 oysters, bone marrow, lamb neck, duck breast, ahi tuna, tilefish, mushrooms, lemon tart, carrot/pineapple cake, and Apple pie a la mode.They offered us a bread basket first and I wasn't too impressed with their bread as it was a bit dry and overly chewy.The bone marrow app was good, but I kind of thought it tasted like fat. The flavors were really interesting especially with the roasted garlic head.The oysters were really small!I ordered the duck, so I can write about that more in detail. The duck was served with a duck leg and six or so slices of duck breast. The duck breast was beautifully cooked, but coated in a thick layer of oil. The leg was really moist, mmmm my favorite word. The best part of the dish by far was the strawberry-rhubarb compote which seriously brought everything together with a palate-tingling tang.The mushrooms had a great flavor but I found that some bites were SUPER salty. Good variety of mushrooms though.My brother and I shared the apple pie for 2. Whenever I eat warm pie, I have to eat it a la mode. If not, it's not worth it. This pie was my favorite meal of the night. I loved the caramelization of the crust, and the not-too-sweet filling. The ice cream brought out the flavors and brought some unique flavors, textures, and temperatures to the dessert. All in all, I liked blue duck tavern. But it cost us a hefty hefty sum that I kind of wish we spent on 3-4 dinners at a normally priced restaurant.",Clarice H.

Our request was honored and we had our own table. When our server brought the menus they had typed Happy Birthday on them. It was a nice simple gesture. Our food was great. We has the pecan sticky buns, the brown butter pancakes, and the hot fried chicken biscuit. We also had to try the hand cut fries that everyone has been talking about. When they brought the sticky buns out they wrote happy birthday on the plate and lit a small birthday candle! Totally unexpected and super sweet. The food was great. Tons of flavor in the fried chicken. The coleslaw was perfect; not too sweet, not to dry. My husband really enjoyed his pancakes. They were light and fluffy. They came with a hazelnut crumble and the texture was perfect. The fries! They were really good. The dipping sauce was awesome! I am so glad we decided to try them.Our server was perfect.

The bone marrow was just okay but it's always fun to try something different, especially at brunch.

172,Ashburn,2018-02-25,hLgJ4QGt-ouuDJdg0pPKiQ,3, VA,Should be renamed to Cold Duck Tavern. Kitchen let us down tonight. Service was excellent but the pace of the meal was way off. After getting our 1st course everything went wrong. Ordered a Butchers Cut and Duck entree which took over 30min to arrive and when they did both were cold. Sent the Duck back only to have it come back only slightly warmer. Ruined the whole experience. Waiter did make it up to us but the kitchen let everyone down. That being said quality and taste of food was excellent ...just wish it would have been warm?,Joe G.

We left the kids at home and that was a good call. I didn't note any other kids here.  This place has nearly 2,000 positive reviews so I will keep it simple. The hubby recommends bone marrow as a starter. I LOVED the broccolini.  Everything else is equally delicious but those were the two that stood out to us.Also to note, every dessert is made there.

If it's a regular item and not a seasonal special, it's absolutely worth trying. We were told it feeds two; in reality, it can comfortably feed four (see picture).The texture of the BDT fries were overly starchy and lacked the crisp that we would expect.The service was outstanding; the waiter very attentive. He definitely earned brownie points for bringing my wife a complimentary desert to congratulate her for being almost done with the pregnancy.The decor was very formal, but they seem to be more at ease with travelers wearing jeans and t-shirts then other Michelin rated restaurants in the area.",Duy V.
176,Northwest Washington,2017-08-10,HFLl1IiVfwdB21ezhUcoUw,5, Washingto,"Have been eyeing Blue Duck Tavern for many years and finally had the perfect occasion to check it out earlier this week. When they called to confirm my reservation, I mentioned that my friend had just gotten engaged and we were celebrating. Upon arrival we had custom ""congratulations"" menus waiting and two glasses of very delicious sparkling rose. It definitely set the whole experience off on the right foot!We started with foie gras--it was plated beautifully and was served with charred nectarine and really flavorful figs. I wouldn't have changed a thing about this dish.We both had picked out what we'd planned to order well ahead of time (duck for me, scallops for my friend), but those plans quickly changed upon hearing the specials! We always make a point of ordering different meals and trying each other's, but this time there was no question- we were both getting the quail stuffed with homemade stuffing and foie gras, served over truffle mashed potatoes. Holy smokes. The quail was cooked perfectly and the stuffing was some of the best I've ever had. We also got a side of charred broccolini to share, and it was objectively PERFECT- super garlicky and tender and delicious!For dessert we decided we'd share the sour cream cheesecake and chocolate mousse. I liked that the cheesecake was a bit lighter than regular cheesecake--so good. The mousse was equally delectable! We were also lucky enough to receive some complimentary cherry sorbet and blackberry frozen yogurt. Everything was SO. GOOD, but weirdly I think my favorite thing was the frozen yogurt. (I have never said anything positive about frozen yogurt in my life.) The whole meal was seriously fantastic but I could also see myself coming back here regularly just to grab a dessert or five.Also of course worth noting is the excellent and attentive service. Not overbearing, responsive to what we needed/didn't need (and sensitive to timing), and most importantly to me--gave GREAT menu recommendations. Will definitely be back.",Rachel S.
177,Vienna,2016-12-13,Io_4kqDZi6CsNtgB-XqamA,4, VA,"I'm dreaming of a BDT cocktail...So, my husband and I went to BDT a few years ago, and hadn't been back since. I remember us thinking the food was ok, not great, the restaurant was loud, and it was pricey (for what you got).Present day: it's still loud, it's still pricey, but the food was delicious, the drinks were FABULOUS, and we're planning to go back next weekend.I made a reservation for BDT several months back - we'd been wanting to try it out again, and since they got awarded a Michelin star, reservations are hard to come by. We arrived at the restaurant around 5:45pm for a 6pm reservation and decided to go into the lounge and get a drink before dinner. We found a nice, cozy table with two oversized chairs (the bar itself has about 10 seats total and it was crowded). The lounge is expansive, with tons of seating spread over a wide space with very high ceilings, and was about 1/3 full when we got there.After settling in, my husband got up to go check out the restaurant - came back asking if we could sit in the lounge for dinner. He said the restaurant remains very loud (maybe because of the open kitchen?) and just liked the vibe of the lounge better (plus, since it wasn't so loud, we could actually hear the Christmas music that was playing from the speakers).We started with drinks. Really creative and seasonally focused drink menu - about 8 specialty cocktails and two mocktails, and I have to admit, I honestly wanted to try all of them. I started with the ""pumpkin creamy"" cocktail which had pumpkin, coconut, and spices, while my husband did the apple, tequila, and cinnamon cocktail. Mine actually came with a salted caramel pretzel stick, and both were fabulous. As for food, we started with the sweetbreads tagliatelle - very tender sweetbreads, loved the red wine au jus, and the pasta was cooked to perfection.  They provided bread with salted butter - I was a little disappointed that the bread was cold, but not really a big deal. Next, upon serious consideration of the menu  - there were so many things I wanted to try - I got the halibut and my husband got the gnocchi with lobster. My halibut was prepared beautifully - a slight crisp on the skin with juicy meat, and the flavors of my husband's gnocchi/lobster were just unbelieveable. For dessert, we got another round of cocktails (noticing a theme)? Service was great all night with the exception of when one of my cocktails took a while. As I mentioned, the lounge was about 1/3 full when we arrived at 5:45 but was packed by 7pm. I think it's a great alternative to the dining room if you can't get a reservation or are looking for something a little more intimate/quiet.",Laurie W.

179,Baltimore,2016-10-18,N4NCKQCHL3SMzlAwJ3g63Q,1, MD,"Wow, not quite sure what to think. I've been to Blue Duck Tavern twice. The first time for breakfast, I got a Seasonal Fruit Plate ($13), House Made Bircher Muesli ($12), and Belgian Waffle ($18) for two. Although pricey, food was worthy of 4 stars - simple, clean, but tasty. The waffles were also noteworthy, as they were light, crispy, and pleasantly sweet. However, my most recent visit was a completely different experience. I came with 3 girl friends for brunch and opted for the BDT Omelet ($18) - egg whites with spinach, mushroom, goat cheese. It came with a slice of toast. The first thing one of my girl friends said upon presentation of the dish was ""that looks like an egg cocoon"" and that was the perfect way to put it. It looks really unappetizing (literally a lone, sad looking omelette with absolutely no attention to presentation/aesthetics). I don't even think I took a photo of my food because it was embarassingly unappetizing. Furthermore, the omelette itself was extremely mediocre. I can't believe I paid $18 for what I could have made better at home (and I am not much of a chef). I was thinking about giving this place 2 stars to acknowledge my better first visit, but the second experience was so mediocre that I think 1 star is appropriate at this point. Their other food looks better, so if I ever come back I'm definitely going for something else.",Jane W.

Take a look at you now, a 2 star Michelin restaurant!I remember the most delicious, but very expensive meals. It's Southern cooking with Beltway elegance (of course, I made that up). I also remember the Park Hyatt. The experience reminds me of my early 20s when life was carefree (when I had Motorola Razr and Yelping was not yet a thing).Fast forward a decade, it has become one of the best restaurants in the world.The drawback: It's never easy driving from Charlottesville to NW DC. Heck, it's not even easy driving even if you're from anywhere in the DMV! I have reviewed another Michelin Star restaurant in Sperryville, VA and while it was a long drive, it was beautiful and scenic. The food: Ordered braised beef rib but it could use some moisture. The amuse bouche was pleasant as well. The APPLE PIE is the pièce de résistance. It's the best apple pie I ever had! Although, they brag of the farm to table movement in their website, still, the closest farms are still 3-4 hours away. Expect the meat and produce to sit in traffic on I-66 (or from up north) to I-495 to I-395 to M, N and O. Overall, great food and best place to hangout if you're in the Georgetown area.",Jin T.

We chat about things to do in D.C. and where we come from. They tell me they're from California visiting. Their destination is the Ritz Carlton on the West End. I'm sure that's a mistake.I pull up to the Park Hyatt Washington D.C. I say: ""Your destination is on the right side, through those large black doors."" ""This isn't the Ritz"" ""Correct, it's your destiny."" They get out of the car, confused and slightly angry. Suddenly, the faint smell of sandalwood and crab cake wafts past their nose.

Blue Duck is inside a fancy Georgetown hotel, the Park Hyatt, so you can imagine the decor and level of sophistication of its patrons. We definitely didn't fit in, but I like bringing a little color to these type of establishments. The host and our servers were cordial, even though we were seated in the back. My short rib hash and biscuit were tasty, and the strawberry jam really set it off. My son didn't enjoy his omelette too much because of the goat cheese overload.

He ordered the filet mignon of the night and seemed to enjoy it. We split the asparagus and grits as side dishes. An aside - it was my first grits experience and not sure any ol' grits for now on will do for me. Perfect amount of food. It was all top notch quality and awesome service.

187,McLean,2018-03-05,fJoBVPA9wS0S7XAX-VGaNQ,4, VA,"# Blue Duck Tavern## General overview of the restaurant * Blue Duck Tavern is a New American style restaurant that has managed to decorate itself with one Michelin star. Their specialty includes charred bone marrow, dry-aged whole roasted duck, and well-balanced dessert selections. They are owned and operated by Hyatt which offers both pros and cons. ---## Atmosphere Rating (4.5/5)## Atmosphere Review* Blue Duck Tavern (BDT) does a great job at executing the current trend. They use terribly uncomfortable chairs, but their interior design offers both luxury and comfort. The dining room can get a bit dark, so it's perfect to dine here with your in-laws. They also offer a small, full-service bar. I have only had great experiences with the bartenders here. They fully understand how the service industry works. ---## Staff Rating (2/5)## Staff Review; Michelin One-Star Standards* I would like to first start off by saying how amazing their bartenders are. Hyatt should most definitely give them a raise. Without them, I would have wondered how this place received a one star from Michelin. I am always amazed at their professionalism and their understanding of the service industry. I cannot say the same for the other waiting staff here at the Blue Duck Tavern. They give off an unwelcoming and unhelpful vibe. They are also extremely slow with service. I once had to wait full ten minutes just for my carbonated water to arrive. It turns out they had forgotten my order. From my experience, America seems to have the worst waiting staff when it comes to Michelin star restaurants. I would recommend dining at the bar.... far, far away from the dining areas. Shout out to Luis and Alyssa.---## Food Rating (4/5)## Food Review; Personal Standards* I am most definitely biased when it comes to writing a review for BDT. BDT holds a special place in my heart just because of my multiple pleasant personal dining experiences at this restaurant. This was also one of the first few Michelin restaurants I visited when I began my journey in food/restaurant businesses. I enjoy their food for couple of reasons. Their dishes are almost always well-balanced. Despite the balance, however, expect the dishes to be on the heavier side. This is a New American style restaurant. The dishes here are also well plated. The chefs here work their magic to create well balanced dishes. It changes every three months, but the changes aren't too drastic. I wouldn't say I was mind blown by the BDT chefs' creativity, but they always provide me with a very pleasant experience. I only say that I was not ""mind blown"" simply due to other Michelin restaurants taking things above and beyond. If you are comparing BDT to New American style restaurants in Virginia & Maryland, then BDT is so much better. I also want to mention how amazed I am at the size of their operation. They keep up with the quality of their dishes while serving to not only the guests at the huge dining hall, but also to the individual hotel guests.  It's just insane how they can keep up with the quality & operate this well.---## Tidiness Rating (4/5) ## Tidiness Review+ It honestly depends on the staff when it comes to cleanliness of the table. They seem to meet the Michelin one-star level of tidiness every time I visit. In other words, everything was always clean.---## Conclusion* Blue Duck Tavern is a leader in New American style restaurants. Their bar experience is phenomenal, but some of their waiting staffs require retraining. You will most definitely receive good food here, but may not be paired up with the proper waiter/waitress. Don't expect to be greeted with a smile either--their hostesses are most definitely not the most pleasant people on Earth. If you want a superb BDT experience, go through the hotel entrance, sit at the bar, and wait to be served. If either Luis or Alyssa is working on the night you visit, then you are in luck.",Fat E.
188,McLean,2018-01-07,wjbKXddaBXNjfeSE66XMLw,3, VA,"Tried this place after hearing rave reviews and also because the restaurant has a Michelin Star. We were seated indoors, right across the open kitchen. After sitting down we immediately began to smell the smoke from the kitchen. While it was bearable for the first 10 minutes, after than we could not stand it. In regards to the service, I think that was the greatest disappointment. Our server seemed to have his attention everywhere else but our table. For 10 minutes I tried hailing down a waiter for just water. I understand people have their off days but this was beyond unacceptable. Foods: Their cranberry bread was delicious. We had the soup of the day which was a mushroom cream soup--it honestly reminded me of any other mushroom soup I have had (nothing special or memorable). I had the salmon which was pretty delicious and cooked how I requested. The brussels sprouts and butternut squash sides were also good. We passed on the desserts.Overall, food was nothing too special and likely would not return back.",V M.
189,Washington,2017-05-01,eV_pWwekms8aluWQ67W-pw,3, DC,"I've eaten here twice.  Once before they earned their Michelin star and once after.  The dining experience I had prior to their earning their star was sadly much better than the one I had tonight.  The biggest issue was the service - incredibly, incredibly slow.  We waited 3.5 hours for our soup, entrees, and dessert.  3.5 hours on a Monday night and it wasn't a holiday.  Just a regular ole Monday night.  There's just no excuse for that.  But the service also meant the food came out cold.  My scallops were cold, and the ""famous"" apple pie - the pie was room temperature (not warm like it was clearly meant to be) and the ice cream had half-melted when it got to our table.  Clearly also not how it's meant to be.  For a Michelin start restaurant and a nearly $200 tab for two people, this meal should have been one for the record books.  It wasn't.  Not even close.  The only reason it got 3 starts was because of the first - and much superior - dining experience back in 2012.",Sarah M.

191,San Jose,2017-03-22,T5C2xaPzofWH_bDa4th5Sg,3, CA,"I got a chance to try this place a few years ago with a friend who lives in DC after he recommended several places. He prefaced my whole visit by stating that the quality of food in DC is just not as high as it is in the Bay Area. Something may be well rated, but it isn't the same kind of well rated as SF. I had really high hopes since photos looked great and the place had an amazing feel and atmosphere, however ... as soon as the food came I understood what he meant.We tried a huge variety of things and shared them together. I think every dish sounded great, and had some great flavors but all together it just wasn't that impressive. I think we also had some wine, which was alright. Either way, I wasn't super impressed by bone marrow and its preparation as well as foie gras. Mine was kind of dry ...So I don't know.

We chose the whole dry aged duck, a special item thats not on the menu every night due to the days it takes to prepare. Yes, DAYS, including the dry aging.

193,Honolulu,2017-07-02,Y490WvAL3BAS69pDS4iOnA,5, HI,"Five stars for great food and amazing service from Liz!This is my favorite restaurant in D.C. My mother and I went here last week for brunch and found out that brunch is only available during the weekends. Nevertheless, the lunch menu was phenomenal. We had the sakura green tea, braised beef rib, wild mushrooms, BDT fries, baby gem salad, and the apple pie with ice cream (of course). Everything was delicious! The braised beef was flavorful and melted in your mouth. The mushrooms were probably my favorite side. The salad was okay. The dressing was light, but the veggies here are so good you can honestly eat them on their own. The BDT fries were more like fried mash potato sticks. I liked them as a starch element for my meal, but on its own, regular fries are probably better. The apple pie with vanilla ice cream is a MUST. Just know that it is HUGE. Four people can probably share this dessert. You were warned. Our server Liz was AMAZING. She made great recommendations, was extremely patient with us, had great people skills, and went above and beyond what was required of her. I've worked in customer service for six years now and I am a server myself. I know good service when I see it. Liz made sure our drinks were always full, made sure we liked everything we received, cleaned the table every time I made a mess, checked up on us consistently and even brought us a brunch menu in case we wanted to come back during the weekend. Our experience was so great that we decided to return and we had Liz make us a reservation in her section. We came back today for brunch. BEST.MEAL.OF.OUR.ENTIRE.TRIP. We started with sorbet mimosas (to die for). Then we had the short rib hash, soft shell crab and waffles, cheesy grits, and the caramel custard with funnel cake. We also ordered pecan sticky buns to go. Everything was tasty. The short rib hash with the poached egg was my favorite but the waffles from the soft shell crab and waffles were the best I've had. They were light and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. I HATE a soggy waffle. These were awesome. Liz served us again and I was surprised that she remembered little details about us from our previous visit. Her service was just as wonderful today. Many servers can be great on occasion, but few are consistently good at their job. Liz is one of the few. Great job. If I am ever in D.C. again, I will be back.",Isa M.

195,Washington,2017-08-27,H1pv-lFFAXWxArtlMCGYng,5, DC,"For a year, I was walking down M street from work home. From time to time, I noticed a lively patio area with a fountain at a corner restaurant. That same minute, while passing by the restaurant, I was curious to check it out, but would quickly forget to follow up/read about it when I returned home. So, a couple of weeks ago my boyfriend made a reservation for 5:30 pm Saturday dinner at  Blue Duck Tavern. We walked to the restaurant and I realised that is the place I wanted to check out for a year.We entered through gigantic, non-human size doors and ended up in a small lobby/greeting area. Nobody greeted us and we even got slightly confused on where to go from there. I initiated a conversation with one of the three women in uniform in that small enclosed space and they said we will get seated shortly (without asking for the name on the reservation or anything!). A couple of minutes later we had another conversation with one of the women after which she promptly showed us to our table. Our table was in a part of the restaurant where we were literally by ourselves. It felt very strange as we were sitting along the window, with about 10 tables for two set-up, all unoccupied. I even started asking our server how busy the restaurant gets on a Saturday night. I know 5:30 pm is early for dinner, but that was the only time available for our reservation!Around 6:00 pm more couples started flowing in, people filled the above mentioned patio, and the whole experience started resembling a social dinner in the capital (phew!). Now to FOOD,  for starters, we ordered marinated octopus. The dish had multiple ingredients with pink colored, slightly sour octopus, marinated red peppers, puree of cauliflower and small pieces of other vegetables. The presentation was amazing, the dish interesting, but a bit cold. We liked it, but were not blown away.For ENTREES, I ordered black cod and my boyfriend ordered braised beef. I had two perfectly cooked pieces of fish, not overcooked or dry, not over-salted, with a perfect crust.  It came with several pieces of zucchini, which were all right if you like the taste of (almost) raw vegetables. The braised beef was heavenly. I don't like steaks because they are somewhat raw. So, this (huge) piece of meat was perfect for me: fully cooked, flavourful, slightly sweet, with a crust.  It came with an interesting mini side dish - pea shoots with slight lemon-like dressing.We also ordered brocollini, as a side dish, that was cooked with olive oil, red chili flakes and garlic. As a compliment, we got GRITS! I'd never order grits myself, but I was glad our server decided to treat us to a complementary side dish. The grits were rich, creamy, with cheddar lcheese and topped with popped brown rice. It was a perfect side dish for both fish and beef.Usually, when we dine out, we order one dessert to share. This time, for some reason, we decided to try two different desserts and were blown away. I had frozen coconut parfait with bits of cantaloupe, purple sugar and flowers, and green pandan sponge cake. Another dessert was a very creamy, gentle (but not fatty) cheesecake with a compote of blueberries.  We also ordered tea, and their TEA collection is grand. If you are a tea connoisseur, you will be blown away. After devouring two desserts, and about three refilled pots of tea, we got two pieces of chocolate fudge as another complement. Overall,  the combination of price/experience/value/taste is amazing. Oh, and one (small piece of) advice to servers. I do like when you explain what is on my plate, but please don't point at things so close. A couple of times I felt like our server was about to touch our food with his fingers.

Everything was great, from the food down to the service, bathroom, and the clearing of the dishes. Yes, the food was worth the price tag but it was not the best of the best. Regardless, everything was cooked and seasoned to absolute perfection. -  Roasted bone marrow: slightly underwhelming in terms of taste, difficult to scoop out, but pairs well with a small amount of roasted garlic smeared onto toast. -  Roasted eggplant with sunflower gremolata and tomato gastrique: really just tasted like ratatouille. -  Scallops with roasted plums in Prosecco chili broth: perfectly cooked scallops with quarters of soft pulms. The chili broth was room-temp and not spicy, just with a subtle peppery kick. -  Crabcakes with Bourbon corn succotash: baseball-sized cakes made with lump crab meat sitting on top of what tasted like coconut curry succotash. -  Pumpkin cheesecake as the market dessert. I was kinda upset that the menu stopped offering boeuf tartare. It was probably half the reason for my initial visit. My server suggested the beef heart to start with, alongside the bone marrow, but I politely declined. She actually noted that most tartare is made with heart anyway. Still declined.",Silvie C.

Went to BDT to celebrate an anniversary and had an amazing time! The service was amazing, and they made us feel so special to be celebrating there. The menu was difficult to get through, only because I wanted to order one of everything! Luckily our server made some excellent recommendations and we ended up with Bone Marrow (a MUST HAVE), the short ribs, the duck, brussels sprouts, and the 'fries' (in quotes because they are more like tater tots on steroids, but oh so good). The meat of both the ribs and the duck was so tender and flavorful. I loved that the food was served family style allowing for great sharing. Dessert was a big standout, we went for the chocolate mousse and the butterscotch pudding (complete with mini funnel cake) and both were awesome. Celery ice cream, who knew it could be so good?Overall, an amazing experience. Can't wait to return!",Anthony J.
198,Austin,2016-12-03,OYIYrxQuiY74GRnjM2XqsA,3, TX,"I had high hopes for Blue Duck Tavern as a trusted food friend raved about this place, from their execution of food to their superb service/hospitality, yet, my experience was mediocre.The bf booked a 9 PM reservation via Open Table and we were greeted and seated quickly, yay.  However being a recently nominated Michelin Star restaurant, I feel like they couldn't keep up with the demand and their typical high standards were compromised.  Our waiter was so busy (they seemed to have a very lean crew), and he tried his best to keep up, but in the end our experience from food to service was a bit underwhelming for a finer dining establishment.FOOD:Seasonal Soup of the day was a mushroom bisque with pickled shallots, absolutely delicious, nice and creamy and full of mushroom flavor with the right amount of salt and the perfect picklyness provided by the shallots. (5/5)Wood Oven-Roasted Bone Marrow with five spice and breadcrumbs, OMG I would come back just for this dish, especially if you are a fan of bone marrow!  This went so well with the fermented garlic and made an amazing spread to go with their toasted bread!  Wait for this toasted bread if you like hot bread, as their house bread isn't. (5/5)Hand-Cut BDT fries, ok I prefer my fries on the thinner side, but if you prefer chunkier (think of a rectangular croquette) these are the fries for you!  Oh, and I also liked the garlic aioli, it was a must as the fries didn't have as much flavor (3.5/5)Crispy Brussels Sprouts were indeed crispy and lemony which I enjoyed, but I didn't care for the side dipping sauce. Also, as many have mentioned, the portion is a bit sparse. (4/5)Mojo Marinated Quail-AVOID THIS dish, the first one was cold and so they remade it and apologized for it being undercooked.  However, the second time was overdone, but our waiter was nice enough to remove this from our bill. (1/5)Organic Chicken with fermented Onion Vinaigrette and fruit tree honey-So, we ordered this per our friend's recommendation being the moistest chicken ever...Ours had pieces that were fairly moist and not overly dry, but not all.  However, I must say they did a good job with the flavor profile/ glaze. (3.5/5)SERVICE:Good job clearing and cleaning tables and keeping beverages filled, but I was looking for that above and beyond kind of service.  A wine glass was shattered next to us, I had to request for my coat to be checked, wasn't provided a purse stool, and wasn't offered that ""a little something treat of an after dinner amuse-bouche"" as other around us received =(.  OH, also our dinner lasted FOREVER, we waited over 30 minutes for our food...and I think because of this, the people who arrived AFTER us paid and left BEFORE us.  By the end of the night, I was tired, still hungry, and dessertless.",Tiffany L.

200,Arlington,2017-11-08,YE-uToSoyl3qXinDgsc98Q,5, VA,"Stop wondering if you should go and book a reservation already!What a wonderful experience!!  First of all, we were seated near the open kitchen which I LOVE!  Seeing the buzzing chefs and flames always appeal to me, so I was so thankful we had a great view.  We were celebrating and the team at Blue Duck Tavern were amazing!  Friendly service from Shankar who explained the entire menu and some fun facts about the restaurant.  Our sommelier Louis went through wine options with us and helped us choose the perfect bottle of Chabis for our meal.  We started with cocktails, and I took a chance on a the Texas Carnival - a mix of caramel and bacon flavored spirits that hit the spot. A fun change from the usual happy hour selections.  On to the food!  I took most of the Yelp recommendations and ordered the bone marrow and braised short rib.  Everything I was expecting and more.  The bones had SO MUCH MARROW.  We've all been to those places that offer bone marrow and have been disappointed by the teaspoon amount at the same (or even higher) prices offered by the BDT.  This dish did not disappoint, and I may break my rule of never ordering the same dish twice because of it.  Some reviews pointed out that the BBQ salt or the beef topping masked the taste of the marrow.  I quite enjoyed the mix, and there was enough 'pure marrow'  underneath to sneak a few bites without any topping.  Best of both worlds for me. The braised beef was tender and the vinegar in the chimichurri was great to cut some of the fat. I didn't enjoy the Jerusalem artichokes, but that's a personal preference, not a comment on how they were cooked. My hubby loved them.My husband ordered the carrot soup and black ink pasta with scallops as an entree.  Both dishes so well presented and every detail was noted.  I was surprised as the carrot dish was served cool.  If you're expecting a hot creamy carrot soup, don't order this. It was amazing, just not warm.  The scallops were fresh and tender and the squid ink gnocchi had such a nice chew.  Side note - The table next to ours got the whole roasted duck. I had food envy instantly. The lacquered duck is in my future, I just need more people to enjoy it with, as it's quite the huge portion for two. Then came the apple pie... It looks like a meat pie straight from the streets of London but triple in size.  It's got tall sides and a raw sugar on top for a great crunch with perfectly cooked apples inside and not overly sickeningly sweet. Excellent!  Again, a huge portion and easily could be shared between 3 or 4.   The food, ambiance, wine, and warm staff were unforgettable, and we'll be back soon! Well deserved Michelin star.",Malene G.
201,South River,2017-07-10,j6CmJPQJCbzvI07t3Ye5Tw,5, NJ,"I have been to BDT a number of times and I cannot say enough good things about the restaurant. From the ambience, high ceilings, service and especially the food -- it is easy to understand why it has earned a Michelin star. I have only dined once for dinner but many times for breakfast/brunch. Checking in is always pleasant and the staff is extremely knowledgeable of all menu offerings and are very attentive. I love the open kitchen concept as well. My favorite menu item remains the Short Rib Hash, it is a rich dish but so worth it, and the biscuit it comes with is unmatched. The sticky buns are also a favorite -- delicious. As for brunch drinks, the sorbet mimosas are excellent as well as the organic smoothie. Hats off to BDT and if you are only in the area for a limited amount of time, make it a point to stop in.",Denise K.
202,Manhattan,2018-01-06,1nZR4-gsAy2OmCPk1IsDfg,4, NY,This is a very great deal for Michelin one star resturant. The brisket hash is so delicious and the fresh toast tastes very nutty. The food is absolutely delicious. However the service might not be up to standard for a restaurant in Park Hyatt. There has been clear miscommunication among the staff because there are several different staff come to table ask do we want to order after we've place our order a while ago,Shiyu S.
203,Los Angeles,2017-12-24,_M-wDLECeX99jAMI--KTVQ,3, CA,The food is just mediocre. Was really disappointed with the famous short rib hash: overcooked and too much seasoning. And they overprice everything here.,Xinran S.

The meals took slightly longer to come out than expected, although we didn't even notice because we were catching up. Our waitress (I believe her name is Gladis) apologized and when our meals came out she brought two sides and dessert on the house. It was very much appreciated even though it was not at all necessary! My group ordered the duck, the pork loin and the rockfish. The duck was the best of the three, but all of the meals were delicious! The cauliflower and gnudi sides were also great as well. In all, I can't recommend this restaurant enough!",Chelsea D.
205,Sacramento,2017-05-08,IgdeX3vAJCanpCSB7Oy8qA,5, CA,"We came here for dinner this past weekend while visiting D.C. I had really high expectations because of the reviews and the reputation. It did not disappoint. Our waitress was excellent (Keera was her name) and she was so knowledgeable and funny and made our experience really nice. The food was fantastic and the service was great. We started with the charcuterie and cheese board and it was really unique, lots of good cheeses and a chicken liver pate that was out of this world. I had the duck breast for dinner and it came with the breast and a leg and both were cooked to perfection. Our tables shared a few sides- the grits, the asparagus, the broccolini and the creamed spinach. Our favorite was definitely the grits, they were SO good and I don't really even like the texture of grits. The creamed spinach was incredible as well. For dessert, we had the chocolate ganache and it was almost too pretty to eat. Everything was seriously amazing and the wine that we chose with dinner was great as well. This place is NOT cheap obviously, but it is worth it for the experience. I'd highly recommend Blue Duck Tavern!",Cara C.

I guess the prices are Michelin-like, but overall atmosphere, food, and service do not compare to the other Michelin star- rated restaurants in DC. If you're looking for a nice, memorable meal in DC, I'd recommend somewhere else. If you're trying to find a safe, uninteresting, restaurant to take your parents or for a business dinner, this is your place. We got the cheese board, fried green tomatoes, grits, scallops, the braised ribs, and lemon meringue tart. Of those dishes, I would recommend the grits, ribs, and tart.",Sabrina H.

Tye bone marrow appetizer was the best preparation I ever had. Oysters were cold and fresh. All the fish was wild, all the produce was organic as was the chicken. Everything was farm to table and the chef made a point of letting us know he visits all the farms he buys from. We ordered a lot of vegetables, duck, chicken, fish, charcuterie all delectable. They made me fresh ginger tea and the assortment of desserts were all really good. Sorbet, chocolate cake all fab. If you're looking for a beautiful place to have a special dinner, take important business connections or just want an intimate delicious dining experience GO!

208,Arlington,2017-12-17,NtUalUfnRQh-EYPkYUrwBw,4, VA,"Second time at the blue duck tavern and this time it was during a mini staycation at the Park Hyatt (wonderful hotel!) so I had a chance to enjoy dinner and brunch at the Blue Duck Tavern. Dinner was near perfection. The service was impeccable and I nearly loved every course. We arrived very late for dinner and I was impressed by both the front of house and kitchen staff's unyielding service as we ordered plenty (for a party of 3) and was one of the last tables of the evening. For dinner we started with the bone marrow, crispy pork belly and endive salad with tea-smoked duck breast. The pork belly was perfection - crispy, flavorful, and shareable size. The endive salad was beautifully presented though it could have use a bit more seasoning. Unfortunately the duck on this dish was forgettable. I loved the bone marrow, but I generally love bone marrow. My only gripe would be that the beef cheek marmalade was a bit of an over indulgence atop an already rich bone marrow. Though the marmalade was quite delicious, it over shadowed the main feature of the dish. I wonder if they would serve the marmalade as a separate dish with their delicious bread. This would be great during brunch with an egg on top!For our main course we had the 70 day dry aged ribeye, Sakuna Bay salmon, beet root gnocchi, squid ink pasta w/bay scallops and a side of potato purée. The ribeye was well seasoned and I appreciate that the chef indulged my request for medium rare w/a Pittsburg char. It was delicious though not the best cut of ribeye I've had - my expectations were high for a Michelin starred restaurant I suppose. My favorite dish was the beet root gnocchi - well balanced in flavor and texture and I loved the presentation. The squid ink pasta was a little underdone for my taste but the scallops were perfectly cooked and seasoned well. The dish was pulled together w/just the right amount of Uni Veloute sauce. I had a chance to try just a bite of the salmon before I was too full but it was seasoned and cooked well though nothing profound stood out about the dish. The potato purée was served with charred grapefruit which was an interesting paring - I didn't hate it and didn't love it. The purée itself was delicious so I think I'd prefer it without the grapefruit. For desert we shared the bahibe chocolate custard which was just sweet enough for me as don't like overly sweet deserts. The corn ice cream was my favorite element of the dish.I should write a separate review for brunch as it was figuratively and literally a night and day experience. Our service was very, very, very slow. We ordered the biscuits and gravy, smoked salmon and 2 eggs w/bacon. The biscuits and gravy was delicious, I even liked the biscuit which is impressive as I live in fear of choking on a dry biscuit. The sausage gravy was delicious, great texture and flavorful so I forgot it was chicken sausage instead of pork. My smoked citrus-cured salmon dish was disappointing. It was served on its own without toast, bread or bagel. I asked for toast. The crème fraiche was the best part of the dish whereas nothing else contributed to enrich or pull it together. The saving grace of very slow service is that I had a few rounds of their delicious sorbet mimosa. This is the one thing you must have during brunch at blue duck tavern.",Mim L.
209,Torrance,2016-10-09,c9cScf_uiujCDoi_E1E0gA,5, CA,"We had a fabulous and elegant brunch to end our D.C. trip. Nice, clean modern and professional space attached to the Park Hyatt hotel. Our waiter Robert is very cordial, accommodating with navigating the menu, and overall superb in service.Very simple and clean. The menu exhibits seasonal faire. Focus of the menu seams to be holiday spices, pumpkin and American favorites. For drink I had the apricot mimosa, my spouse had the the ""cafe"" which has espresso, grand marnier and orange. We ordered pecan buns: maple glazed cinnamon bun topped with caramel sauced pecans surprisingly not too sweet! Bone marrow: oh the marrow with toasted bread roasted whole garlic side to spread and oregano sprig. So decadent and sinfully  rich. In ordered their ice Macha and my spouse had their seasonally rum drink featuring pimpkin. Brunch entree : breakfast croissant with glazed pork belly omelette style egg and cheese. The croissant was so flaky and buttery! My spouse had the fried chicken and biscuit open face with sunny side up runny egg. The biscuit sits on a creamy southern style gravy. The chicken was crisp and juicy. The egg yolk gave the sauce extra refined umph for the gravy. By far a fabulous establishment with delicious cocktails, refined nouveau American style brunch menu, and gentile service. For sure a place to return to maybe for dinner some day.",George L.
210,Concord,2017-04-09,qXUmWYTvV4teS8SkNLYYnA,3, MA,"The food was pretty solid, but my crab cake was mediocre. Too much sauce and too soft everywhere. My daughter's fish dish was tasty, however,  and cooked well. But didn't have a lot of flavor brought out. Other adults who came with us loved their brunch, and their food looked pretty great. However the kids' pasta was just butter and cheese, nothing special. The server was nice and friendly. I was not happy with their ""assorted pastries."" When I order the assorted pastries at the Ritz, they actually give a few different kinds of pastries, and a few of each kind, although miniature-sized. Here, at about the same price, (maybe a couple dollars less) we got exactly three small  pieces of pastries on a plate... for $12. Seriously. Our bloody Mary was pretty strong and nice, the place had a nice ambience and I liked their clean bathrooms that had the sink in each stall. A good place to meet up friends for some drinks and a generic brunch, i think. Nothing screamed out amazing for me. Maybe their regular lunch and dinner times are different, and I will go back to try.",Yui C.

Was expecting more flavor from roasted garlic though. Fried soft shell crab was just ok. No vibrant flavor and a bit greasy but just ok. Foie gras terrine plating was really difficult to share... and I am definitely liking Bouchon's version better.Pork chop was spot on. Rutabaga was yummy. Huge block fry was... unique.Roasted chicken and sautéed mushroom were a little saltier than needed but good.Apple pie was simple and straight forward honest flavor. Combined with cherry blossom ice cream. But besides the cherry color, could not get much flavor.Service was polite and professional as expected but not much beyond - e.g., no invitation to tour open kitchen for out of town visitors.

213,Washington,2017-05-08,Zgjr63gDOEog1pXs6NHVsQ,5, DC,"One thing to note before I start my review... SERVICE WAS BETTER THAN THE FOOD. Our waiter Jeremy was freaking amazing. Knew everything about the menu, came at the right time to ask if we needed anything (didn't come too often to annoy us lol) and recommended the best dishes for our first experience. A++++ service!!!Dined here Sunday at 5:30pm (made a reservation for 2) and was seated after a 6-7 min wait at the front. The restaurant is located inside the Hyatt Hotel and is very sleek/modern looking with an open kitchen design. Per our amazing waiter's recommendation we ordered the roasted bone marrow to start, the braised beef ribs, charred broccolini, white corn grits, and the moulard duck breast. I also ordered a cocktail (I have terrible memory and forgot the name but it was a peach flavored vodka with cantaloupe juice). It was not too sweet, not too strong, just perfect, and ended with 3 seasonal flavors of house made sorbet.The complimentary bread/butter was alright. Came with multigrain and sourdough bread and really great soft melty butter. The roasted bone marrow was great. It was really flavorful and spread beautifully on the toast. The only thing I didn't love was that the toast was pretty burnt. The braised beef ribs came with a salsa verde on top and pea shoots on the side. It was good but not something that I will dream about eating again. The moulard duck breast came with a strawberry-rhubarb sauce and was just AMAZING. I liked this a lot more than the braised beef ribs. The duck breast had the perfect amount of fat in each bite and the strawberry-rhubarb (sauces change seasonally) was soooo good. We also ordered a side of charred broccolini (5/5 perfect) and white corn grits (I'm not a huge fan of cheese so the fiscalini cheese was a bit much for my taste but it was still really good). We ended our amazing meal with 3 flavors of sorbet (kiwi, strawberry, coconut). I am actually not a big fan of coconut flavored food items but the coconut sorbet turned out to be the best flavor out of the 3... it was just perfect. Not too strong of a coconut taste, but very flavorful and just perfect. You have to try it. For the kiwi/strawberry it was also really tasty. Can definitely tell that its made in house with fresh ingredients!Overall, my first experience with Blue Duck was FANTASTIC! Would definitely try and come back to try other dishes especially since it is a seasonal menu (with some staple items not changing other than the sauce apparently).",Yoona K.

215,Rockville,2017-04-24,5AtIJNumbcHACS4-WITC-w,4, MD,"Blue Duck has been on my list for awhile now, and after they received their Michelin rating I had to finally check it out. We went with a group of friends for our monthly ""dinner club"" on a Sunday night. ServiceThe service was good and the ambiance was relaxed with a great open kitchen set up. For a normal restaurant this was 5 star service with a stool provided for my purse, proper food delivery and attentive wait staff. There were a few times we thought where's our dessert, or have you seen our waiter? But I think this also comes from watching one too many food documentaries and knowing the standards starred restaurants are held to =)FoodWe ordered a lot of food for 6 of us, and there wasn't one thing we didn't like. We started with the cheese plate and the bone marrow. The cheese plate had a little taste of everything from the house made mustard and pickles to the chicken liver pate and farm fresh cheeses. But the star of the show was the bone marrow, oh my was it heavenly! One couple ordered mixed drinks that they raved about, I wanted something refreshing and non-alcoholic and was pleasantly surprised when he suggested the iced green tea served with a lemon and a sprig of mint.For main dishes we ordered the scallops, veal, duck, and braised beef rib at the table. I believe the duck stole the show. It was cooked perfectly with a cranberry sauce that was delightful. I ordered the braised beef rib which is why I couldn't give this a 5 star review. The beef which they state is braised for 18 hours should have just fallen apart and melted in your mouth. The other person at our table said his was cooked this way; however mine was tough and a bit chewy. The flavor was delicious, but the texture is everything especially at this price point. We ordered a couple of side dishes for the table to share as well. The BDT fries (which we wouldn't have ordered but our server recommended it and we were glad he did!), the blue crab hush puppies, and the asparagus with crispy chicken skin. We loved them all and even ordered a second round of the crab hush puppies!I'm amazed that we still found room for dessert, but when the server had walked me to show me where the restroom was, he pointed out the pastry room and their apple pies that they are known for and I couldn't say no. As a table we ordered the apple pie, carrot cake, chocolate ganache, and meyer lemon tart. The tart stole the show for me, with a mellow lemon flavor and a lavender whip cream accent, it was the perfect combination.",Kime T.

Upon arrival, I was a little skeptical because the service we had received so far was subpar. The hostess and a few of the waiters seemed really stuck up. Gave us some looks as we walked by. Yes, we looked and dressed like tourist. Sorry, we are not from here. Anyways, our waiter was Robert and boy did he turn things around for us. He was very attentive and friendly. Not overly friendly where he is in your face every second. He just popped up at the right times to ensure we had everything we needed. Always filled our waters before we could ask too.Pecan Sticky Buns - We asked Robert how they were and he said he was actually having the kitchen send some out for us on him since it was our first time at the restaurant. I was so shocked at his kindness. We were very appreciative and he was very sweet to do that. The pecan buns are okay. They are a tad by dry but the middle is a little more moist. Large pieces of pecans on them.Chicken and Biscuits - This was different. It has collard greens and I haven't experienced a chicken and biscuits dish with that before. No complaints though, very tasty. Short Rib Hash - I'm not sure if this had potatoes in it but if it did, I wish it had bigger potato chunks in it. If it did not, I wish it did! Lots of meat though. A bit salty for my liking but the biscuit kind of helped cut through it. Matcha Latte - This is true matcha. Not your coffee bean matcha where it's a bit sweet. This is not sweet at all. The almond milk helped it taste a bit better but expect a true matcha green tea taste. Overall, this place is decent but food was just okay. It is pricey but expected since it is located in the Hyatt. Unfortunately, not a place we would want to return to if we ever came back to DC.

I'm not sure what the Michelin process involves, but I've been to plenty of restaurants in the area, in Chicago, and in Indianapolis that are far better than this one and far less expensive. None of us are interested in going back. We put a lot of value on good food, but this didn't earn that distinction.",Ryan L.

The food was excellent and presented wonderfully.  Really appreciated that apple pie desert splurge at the end. Service started off great but we kept seeing less of him as the meal progressed. The decor was stunning. The chairs were extremely uncomfortable and we could barely budge the heavy chair to get it closer to the table. Beautiful high end restaurant perfect for a business lunch, special occasion or a night on the town.",Nancy A.
225,Clarksburg,2018-06-19,v2XZCDbrz9ktJ9KPfOg0lA,4, MD,I have been here twice now and both times I was more than pleased with the food.  The braised beef rib was amazing- along with all of our side dishes.  I was a bit disappointed by the whole rack of lamb which was $120 and was really like a half rack of lamb.  The atmosphere is great too.,Meg G.

227,Dallas,2017-06-25,sB8NlMkhDd35kBmlYN2bjw,5, TX,"Impeccable service. Delicious food. Designed with thought and intention.We arrived for our 8:15 pm dinner reservation on a Saturday night and were promptly seated. We were seated in the Lincoln room which was very beautiful. It was a ""room"" made of glass situated between the bar and a high table with stools. No ceiling so it did not feel enclosed but rather, elegant and intimate. Our wood table had benches with backs and arm rests for seating. Each bench could have comfortable sat two people so while it was just us two for the evening, it would make for an ideal spot for a double date.Our waitress then served us waters and complimentary bread. Through the evening, we each enjoyed two drinks. He two glasses of red wine, me two cocktails. Both refreshing. We then enjoyed the hand-cut BDT fries. Six per serving and each one so delicious! You must order it! The BLF was also great but next time, would probably try something else. The flavor palette was incredible if each piece were combined just right but not striking on its own. We then proceeded to wait a bit afterwards for the main course but once it arrived, we relished in it. I had the special which was a mackerel fillet the waitress recommended over the chicken. It was light, fresh, and filling. Delicious with every bite and appropriate for the summer. My boyfriend's braised beef just tore apart so easily. So much flavor. To accompany our main course, we had three vegetables which was more than enough! In retrospect, we probably should have only ordered one and if I had to choose would probably choose the broccolini over the fried green tomatoes and asparagus. The asparagus was actually given to us by the house but we did not mind! Perhaps for the wait.While we were full, we did not want to pass on the chance to enjoy dessert so we ordered the pineapple carrot cake. Since we were celebrating my birthday, my boyfriend had the restaurant wish me a happy birthday on the plate and it was so appreciated! Again, we had to wait but both the waitress and chef came out and apologized, gave us the ganache dessert as an apology, AND comp'd the cake. Wow! The little annoyed I was quickly dissipated. Thank you BDT! Because of the wait, we left the restaurant ten minutes before eleven. A little later than we had wanted but given both the quality of the food and the incredible service, we left with such a strong and favorable impression of the place. Would definitely work in the favor of anyone trying to impress a date. We will most definitely be returning again!",C M.

The butcher cut, NY Strip, was cooked as requested and the flavors were well balanced. The mushrooms and carrots (side dishes) were probably the best part of the meal. A negative aspect was that it was freezing inside. We asked if they could place us in a slightly warmer place. We were told they would contact the engineers (?!) to adjust the temperature and we could wait another 30 minutes for another table. We stayed, but needless to stay we were freezing throughout dinner.",Nelson C.
233,Washington,2017-09-10,6AASaA6gUgf4GZlZ_ekQnA,4, DC,"This is a long overdue Christmas dinner review. I encouraged my family to skip the hassle and kitchen drama of Christmas (my mom runs a tight ship in the kitchen during the holidays ) and try something new. I did a little research on the best Christmas dinners in D.C. I believe I initially tried for the Hay-Adams, it was fully booked and Blue Duck Tavern was our next option. So very happy that they had a reservation. It was a beautiful way to spend Christmas with my family. I was a little nervous, my mother and brother were skeptical but in the end told me that I made a great choice. They were so happy which made me happy. There aren't enough words to describe how delicious the experience was. The food was incredible, the wait staff were so kind and helpful. The sweet potatoes were incomparable -- I haven't been able to stop talking about them. They were heavenly. It was a perfect evening. I hope they're up for going next Christmas.",jonee N.

There was a bottle of champagne on ice waiting for us, which was a sweet little surprise from my boyfriend. He said that the restaurant was very accommodating with his requests. Our server was very attentive and answered all of our questions with informative answers! We dived straight into the entrees and forewent appetizers (next time!). I got the moulard duck breast and the bf got the steak special of the night. Both were super delicious! I like that the entrees come in pans and everyone gets an empty plate, so that way everyone can try some of everything. For sides, we ordered the BDT fries and sweet potato mash. The mash tasted like Christmas in a good way! The ""fries"" are thick cut and really good with the spicy aioli it comes with. For dessert, we decided on the chocolate ganache with white chocolate ice cream (ugh so yummy). This was on their newly redone dessert menu! There's a new pastry chef who created the menu. Halfway through it, someone came out with flowers from urban stem and what stood out to me was that it came in a vase that the restaurant had to have provided since the company delivers the flowers on bikes in these cute brown paper bag.All in all, I felt super special and well treated on my birthday!

We came Sunday evening to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We were greeted by two lovely hostesses and one brought us to our table. From there, David took care of us - and he was fantastic. Personable, helpful with suggestions, very good timing (didn't come right after a bite of food was taken!). Just overall a really fantastic edition to our overall dining experience. For what it's worth, we were sat at table 15 - so you can see right into the kitchen and watch the detail and choreography of the inner workings while also enjoying a quiet and intimate space.We were given complimentary glasses of champagne and our menus toasted to our anniversary - lovely touches!We ordered the oysters to start. They were OK - my husband and I both prefer a little more grit and saltiness to ours, but they were large and pre-shucked so no complaints.I ordered the evening's special of Cod and it was phenomenal. Probably one of the best dishes I've had. It was light, refreshing, and flavorful - perfect on a humid July night.My husband had the Tuna. It was sushi-grade and perfectly spiced. My husband raved about it for several hours afterwards.We shared the Charred Broccolini and it was the perfect side, and very garlicy - at least we were both eating it :) To cap off, we chose the Butterscotch Pudding, per David's suggestion. My husband is a 100% chocolate for dessert person and he absolutely loved this! The presentation was beautiful, and was the perfect sweet end to a fantastic dining experience.I wasn't sure if BDT was going to live up to the hype and had seen some mixed reviews - but I am pleased to report I was completely impressed. It had everything you want in a meal with none of the pretentiousness that so many DC restaurants boast with. We both left feeling full, relaxed, and very thankful to have been so well taken care of. Thank you to all the staff that made our evening so special!",Melissa H.
240,Manhattan,2017-04-24,pvjj7rlsKY_JKTdUAWs5fQ,2, New Yor,"This review is specifically for the Easter Brunch 2017, and is an update on my prior review.  Our experience was a real headscratcher.  We were left truly disappointed, particularly after being a huge fan of Blue Duck Tavern ever since it opened in 2003.  Something in the formula has clearly changed for the holiday brunch format, as the price point increased (from $95 to $125), restaurant was half empty, and food quality declined.  It felt as though a margin squeeze had severely impacted the quality of experience.  This was not representative of a One Star Michelin experience.Ambiance- Upon arriving at 1pm, we were one of only a few occupied tables in the corridor of tables closest to M Street.  By 2pm, we were literally the only table seated here (see pictures).  These are peak brunch times.- Later clientele seemed unrepresentative of the typical BDT diner, even attempting to get a takeaway bag of items from the open appetizer selection (subsequently removed by manager with some fuss).- Usually accustomed to seeing the restaurant full at holiday brunch, strange to see it empty.Food-Appetizers in Open Kitchen (Buffet Style):  Previously there were more seasonal and fresh dishes on offer.  This go around was mostly basic seafood, meats and cheeses (nothing exotic at that). - Entrees/Sides:  We had Herb Roasted Leg of Lamb and the Oven Roasted Dry Aged Ribeye.  Our server brought all four sides:  Potato Puree, Roasted Cipollini Onions, Braised Collard Greens and Grilled Asparagus.  Very basic dishes, not innovative, and felt as though they were the victim of cost cutting.  In prior years, more of the dishes were those found on the acclaimed normal menu (e.g. grits, BDT fries, etc).  - Deserts in Pastry Pantry:  High point, good selection of tasty treats.BeverageEnjoyed a glass of the 2016 Christian Lauverjat Sauvignon Blanc ($14) from Sancerre, France followed by a glass of the 2013 Argyle Reserve Pinot Noir ($18) from Willamette Valley, OR.  Continue to find the wine program at Blue Duck Tavern offers a reliable selection of wines by the glass.  Blue Duck Tavern has an extensive menu of tea options from the Tea Cellar - sadly, neither of the two options we selected were available, so we did not get to try anything.Service- Lackluster experience, not typical of prior BDT visits.- Waiters disappeared, rarely visiting our table to clear plates, replace cutlery, etc.  Needed to steal forks from neighboring table.- Bill was incorrect, charged for more expensive wine while not charged for other items.",D.

I ended up getting the Short Rib Hash after consulting with the waiter on the more popular dishes. The meal came with and excellent biscuit and orange marmalade.

Overall, pretty overpriced, no vegetarian options...but a beautiful restaurant. It was a really nice day so we decided to sit outside by the fountain so I didn't really get a chance to check out the restaurant in full details. I knew, prior to coming, that this was not a vegetarian friendly restaurant and was generally more recommended for brunch. Now, I know why. I ended up ordered the brussel sprout dish to share and the cauliflower salad. Both were sub-par and I've definitely had better (since it is a staple tapas dish). With that being said, I want to come back to check out the brunch. It would be nice to stop by and then walk over to Georgetown on another nice day.",Tanvi M.
243,Washington,2017-02-11,NMVducy079ccb4xbya1WXQ,4, DC,"BDT is really, really solid. I've come once for brunch and once for lunch and everything is executed really well while not being too pricy. For the most part, their menu lacks creativity, I would say their cuisine places emphasis on ""American"" rather than the ""New."" Thus, nothing has really WOW'd me enough to make me die to come back.If it's your first time, a side of fries for the table are a must, if only because of the novelty. Don't try to eat it all by yourself.The most memorable things I ate here were both off-menu specials -- a PHENOMENAL lobster bisque and a very unique chocolate dessert that stood out because of its creative plating. I highly highly recommend the lobster bisque if it happens to be available again.Service is wonderful, as expected of a Michelin-star restaurant. I dropped my fork at one point, and was about to flag down our waiter but he walked right by us, I thought he didn't notice me, but turns out he was already on his way to grab a new fork for me. Amazing.",Christine Y.
244,New York,2016-06-05,6o1KB1r3b0h7rMB5-MUlhQ,4, NY,"Would definitely return. Service was fabulous once we sat down. Bar seemed to ignore us for the first 5 min, but once we sat down we had nothing but the best experience. Menu is the type where you have a steak on the menu, a few seafood options, some veggie sides...etc. Set up great for sharing as well. We enjoyed the side of mushrooms, puree potatoes, ricotta ravioli-like side (fabulous), crab cake, rabbit ragu orecchiette, and half a dozen oysters. We should've tried the apple pie dessert, but didn't save room. Don't make the same mistake that we did. When we first watched in there is an open kitchen type setting, where one of the chefs was hand crafting freshly made apple pie...it looked decadent. Overall, great place to get some great cocktails/wine and yummy food in a more upscale setting. It is located in the Park Hyatt hotel, with an all glass ambiance. They even have all glass mini rooms within the restaurant that you can dine in and feel as though you are having your own private dinner, but with the view of the rest of the restaurant. Worth asking about if you want a more one on one setting.Would like to go back and also check out their brunch menu.",Victoria O.
245,Burke,2017-11-13,mRU9FKB6z6rJ4ZOmLMyvAA,5, VA,"Absolutely adore this restaurant, it's my favorite restaurant in D.C. The restaurant is a little out of my price range but definitely a good spot for a special occasion. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and I had the most amazing time there. They had a customized birthday menu for me and the service was very attentive and helpful the whole night. We started off with our cocktails, mine was a little too strong for me so I was sipping on it and one of the waiters noticed and asked if I liked my drink or not. I said it was a little too strong and they offered to make me another one. I was just amazed by the attentiveness and their dedication to trying to make each table's experience the best it could be. The restaurant in itself is beautiful, I loved the classy atmosphere and the decor of the restaurant's interior. The whole place was crowded (make a reservation, and make it as early as possible) but my boyfriend and I were still able to share an intimate dinner. Now onto the food!The food was absolutely amazing, we were blown away by every thing we ordered. Listen to the reviews and order the bone marrow, the creamy garlicy taste was just a dream. My boyfriend and I were in awe after taking our first bite. The menu changes but the bone marrow is so good that it's always guaranteed to be on the menu. For our entrees we ordered the duck and the lamb. The duck was cooked perfectly and was paired with some sort of jammy sauce, I don't remember exactly what it was but it was our favorite dish of the night. We also ordered the corn bread and potatoes for our sides. The cornbread was so addicting, it was so moist and buttery. For dessert, we ordered the apple pie and ice cream. We were so full at that point but we just had to try it and it was so worth it. We took it to go but we ended up eating it when we got back home cause it was so good. Definitely will be returning again when I have a special occasion to celebrate.",Ashley H.
246,Charlotte,2016-05-26,CWohVLIex5dCEA8cVjeVNQ,5, NC,Fresh Food. Classy Atmosphere. This restaurant sets the bar for every $$$ price range. I can't believe I haven't been here in the last two years o living in DC. I've never been to a restaurant that featured such an open kitchen as Blue Duck Tavern.  You can literally walk through and see everyone cooking.  That speaks volumes as to their cleanliness standards and level of quality of the food.  Most of their greens are grown and hand picked just outside of the restaurant.  The fish and meats were perfectly cooked. My Mahi Mahi was seasoned perfectly and tasted amazing.  You can taste every little ingredient in the foods served here.  I was shocked to see the waiter come up to my table and provide the women in my party a small stool for their purses!  Incredible attention to detail!!! I highly recommend going here (with reservation) and splurge on every course of food they offer.  You will not regret anything you order here.  The service is absolutely incredible.,Anthony L.

249,Columbia,2017-04-07,BkyVV5dH79CLZA9XMDXCOg,4, SC,"My husband and I flew in on Saturday to D.C. for dinner - anniversary but I booked for lunch instead. We wanted to experience Chef Table dining but did not plan in advance. Choosing spots that were Michelin Star restaurants, we had very high expectations. We were however a bit disappointed. The biscuit that was served with the Short Rib Hash was rather dry, no bread was served prior to our main course , the Bloody Maria seemed to have more horse radish than alcohol and the Sticky Buns were dry and the glaze somewhat bitter. Though we were a bit put off by the lack of ""wow"" from the dishes we chose, I don't find it to be a true reflection of Blue Duck's well earned reputation. I have learned over the years that many things will contribute to a fantastic restaurant having an off- game day. Kitchen staff changes daily , the head/premier chef has to have a break in shifts, going just before they close ; which we did - brunch at 2:00. The wait staff were spot on. So - while not singing absolute praises, we will plan our next visit to experience the Chefs Table and rate it for the expectation it deserves.!",Cheryl A.

251,Richmond,2016-05-05,CFzqhCryJz-P2yrtoUrD7Q,2, VA,"My boyfriend and I had an early Valentine's day dinner and decided to go out of our way to try Blue Duck Tavern after seeing such glowing reviews. Unfortunately, we left disenchanted despite starting off with some pretty good appetizers.-Roasted Marrow- The bone marrow had an everything bagel crust and was served with roasted garlic and butter. The portion of the marrow was generous and it was delicious in all its fatty gloriousness. -Brussel Sprouts-The brussels were cooked to have more of a bite to them and were covered with a unique combination of pimento cheese and a vinaigrette. I think the toppings overwhelmed the flavors of the brussels though and may have been better served on the side. -Hand Cut Fries with Smoke Pepper Aoili-Delicious! These tastes like mini bricks of fried mashed potatoes. Nice, crunchy exterior with a smooth, velvety center.-Braised Beef Rib-Our waiter said that this dish was very ""unctuous"" and after having the marrow-- we were definitely excited for more of the not so good for you but so great to eat fat. Unfortunately all of the hours of braising got rid much of the fat and just lacked that buttery/velvety texture we were expecting. -Roasted Duck Breast with Cranberry Mostrada-Duck was cooked to the medium rare that I request, but was stone cold when it arrived. The duck itself did not have much flavor and there was barely any sauce to help with it.  I was most disappointed with this dish.-Apple Pie-For $20, I expected this pie to be life altering-- but yet again, it was another underwhelming dish. Crust was average and the apples had way too much cinnamon. The pie was just partially warmed through for us so when we broke through the pie, we had partially warm and room temperature apples mixed together. The starters were all pretty good so we were pretty dismayed when the rest of the meal was so lackluster. Perhaps we caught the kitchen on an off night or something, but we left pretty unsatisfied.",Han V.

253,Fairfield,2017-07-19,XMOSXT59qheD0OGud7U2Lg,5, CA,"This was one of the best meals that I have ever had. The entrance is grand with very tall and stately looking doors, and the interior is clad with light colored wood panels that we thought reminded us of a fancy sauna or a spa. You will notice the single 2017 Michelin star upon entering...get excited. It was my birthday, and my boyfriend somehow managed to get custom menus that said ""Happy Birthday"" at the top and had a screenshot of the 'lift' scene from Dirty Dancing (one of my favorite movies) specially for me! Our waiter, David, came over with a grin because he was in on the secret and said he was eager to meet us because of this interesting custom menu choice! It made the experience feel very personal and fun. The menus were taken to the hostess during our meal to keep them away from the food, and later returned to us as keepsakes. Eventually another waitress came over and actually serenaded me ""(I've Had) The Time of My Life"" to make the Dirty Dancing thing come full circle, and that was crazy!! Hands down, amazing service on all fronts. There was always someone nearby making sure that our experience was fantastic.We ordered both of the available mocktails, the oysters as an appetizer, and we chose the swordfish and the half-duck as our entrees, with a side of asparagus. Oysters: This was my first time trying oysters, and I found that I didn't like them too much. My boyfriend, however, loved them. I don't think this has anything to do with the quality of oyster, but more the fact that I hadn't ever tried them before, so this doesn't reflect my rating negatively.Swordfish: This was also my first time trying swordfish, and it was amazing. It didn't taste too fishy, it was juicy and flavorful and a great portion size. I only had a bite since this wasn't my entrée but overall I was very happy with it!Duck: Wow. Just amazing. Since it was an entire half duck, I was able to compare both the thigh and the breast. The thigh was amazingly tender and juicy, and practically fell right off the bone. The breast was also very tender but was sliced into thick pieces almost like a filet mignon and had a flavor I would almost compare closer to red meat than the thigh, which was more along the lines of a poultry flavor. Both cuts practically melted in my mouth. It was perfect to have both cuts, and on the side there was a strawberry rhubarb compote that was a perfect contrast to the savory meat. Asparagus: Some of the best asparagus both my boyfriend and I agreed that we have ever had. It was seasoned extremely well and had a house sauce drizzled over it that complemented it very well.BONUS: Grits: Our waiter brought us out a side of grits on the house, on account of that it pairs very well with the duck that I ordered (and perhaps because when he asked me how the oysters were I said I wasn't too smitten). He was absolutely right. The grits were savory with what I think were caramelized onions to stir up into them. They were a particularly rich savory flavor, and tasted amazing on their own but were also great as a little blob on top of pieces of the duck. Sugar cookies: While we were too full to even attempt a classic birthday dessert, our waiter protested and eventually came back with a little bag of complimentary sugar cookies for us to take out. I was especially pleased with this because it felt like a parting birthday gift for myself. The cookies were perfect bite size, and just the right balance of soft and crunchy, and sweetness. Fun facts: - You can see the chefs cooking from certain parts of the restaurant, and the cooking spaces are just as aesthetically pleasing as the dining spaces. - Each menu item has the source location listed next to it- Our waiter told us that the restaurant has its own honey bees on the roof that they use to make the house honey...how cool is that?!Amazing, amazing experience. Very fancy and I think it was the perfect way to end my teen years and begin my 20s, I will 100% return here if I ever get the chance (and can afford it...lol).",Elena S.

We were celebrating a special occasion, and the staff did a great job making us feel special from customizing our menu to greeting us by name as we walked in, and even gave us a complimentary dish! The food was just as good and had several options for gluten free diets. The duck breast and the brocollini stood out as some of the best bites of the night! If you're in DC, definitely worth checking out!",Tyler Y.

""The single greatest bite of food I've ever had"" was the only way to respond.  The fried chicken was excellent, the wild mushrooms fantastic, blah blah blah, get the bone marrow!",Michael H.
256,Rancho Cordova,2017-10-25,Zv6HVKT7Pq4hI_zMRkRlpg,4, CA,Great food in a casual setting. We had pork belly with beans and cabbage for appetizer which was juicy and scrumptious.  The foie gras terrine was very tasty.  I had the stuffed quail which had a great flavor but a bit challenging to eat. My brother had the duck breast which we all loved! The braised beef ribs and pan seared salmon were good but not memorable. The mixed mushrooms was packed with a lot of flavor! The butternut squash purée was like baby food.,Eugene L.

259,Washington,2018-01-29,SIg5grXVP-u7YQ5pa-mHiA,2, DC,"Butter, salt, duck fat, and a Michelin star.  Underwhelming nonetheless.Two stars because it was a nice evening with friends, after all.  But, the food is overrated.  The table service was very good, but the hostess was not very friendly.  Arrival: we had an early reservation and arrived at the restaurant five minutes prior.  The hostess informed us that the restaurant was technically ""not open"", but that we could wait until our table was ready.  We waited a full 10 minutes before our table was ready, which was odd, considering that we were the first party of the evening at that table and were seated after several other parties that had arrived after us.  Go figure. Service:  Our server was very attentive, if not overeager.  I thought it was funny when he said that he would try to explain the menu items to us, but then proceeded to more-or-less read directly from the menu.  So, that ended up being a useless bit of theater.  Food:  Marrow: I know the bone marrow gets raves, and I truly like bone marrow, but I felt that BDT tries to hard with its preparation.  The bread crumbs and seasonings nearly obliterate the marrow.  This was like being served clams casino when your are expecting oysters on the half shell.  The roasted garlic bulb was a nice touch, though.  If you're into marrow, go elsewhere.  Soup:  My wife enjoyed the sun choke soup, but did not otherwise find it exceptional.  Beef Rib:  The one dish that was excellent.  Tender, well-cooked and presented and the spaetzle was a great touch.Duck Breast:  All credit to the bird that gave its life -- the meat flavor was very, very good.  But it was a little tough and toward the rare side.  I know that duck should not be overcooked, but the rareness accentuated the toughness.  The outer parts were very good and the tomato orange marmalade was a good accompaniment.  Organic Chicken:  Entirely underwhelming.  It was cooked as described, but otherwise tasted little different than what us cooking mortals can pop in the oven.  The roasted root vegetables that came with it, though, were really very good.  Were BDT to offer those as a vegetarian entree, they would get a lot of takers.Salmon:  A companion had this and seemed happy enough.  She'll have to post her own review.BDT Fries:  These were enjoyed by all.  Maybe these were the one thing that merited a Michelin star.Roasted Mushrooms:  Actually, these were very good.  The only problem was that these appeared to be mostly NOT WILD mushrooms.  Indeed, our server explained the varieties and I saw in my dish about 50% button mushrooms, which most likely were cultivated.  Perhaps the dish was ""wild-inspired.""  Respectfully, I think this dish is misleadingly described by the menu.  To me, a wild mushroom dish that does not include any of the following is pulling a fast one:  chanterelle, morel, oyster, hen-of-the-woods.  DESSERT:  We sampled vanilla ice cream, the sorbets, and apple pie.  All were good, the vanilla ice cream exceptionally nice.  The apple pie perhaps was the victim of too-great expectations.  The large, tart apple chunks were very good, and the crust also was made with care.  But, it was difficult to assemble a good bite -- the whole didn't meet the sum of its parts.   Also, one of the three sorbets, the currant one, I believe had some gritty, granular sugar in it that had not dissolved.  Odd.  OVERALL:  The Michelin star raises one's expectations.  The physical space is high-end and comfortable.  The prices are stratospheric (though maybe not astronomical).  But the overall experience was hit-or-miss for me.  The food was VERY SALTY, as is often the case in restaurants.  But at BDT I drank about 6 glasses of water during dinner and still needed another few after returning home.  Also, the sheen of butter and/or duck fat on most of the foods gave a lot of the meal and unctuous quality.  This restaurant raised the bar high, but managed to slide under it.",David S.

263,Irvine,2018-03-06,71_YPUrQVST34ODWZZMhjw,3, CA,"I made reservations for my sister's bday brunch.  I was hoping we could have more people with us but they told us that they could maybe squeeze in one person with our group so 3 people would sit on a bench (seemed like they knew where they could sit us) but when we got there, we were at a big round table and I know we could have easily fit one more person (they were actually removing one extra chair) if not 2 more.  So I was bummed about this, esp when it seemed like there weren't super busy on a Saturday morning.They also personalized the menu by writing a Happy Birthday on it with my sister's name.  That's certainly a plus!  Overall, I thought the service was also attentive - they even had a plateful of cookies with a happy birthday on it for my sister, and a candle, that they brought out after we paid so that's definitely a nice touch - I didn't remind them or ask for this!As far as food goes, I really like the bone marrow, pecan sticky buns, and the brown butter pancakes - they were absolutely relish.  I believe our friend also liked her shrimp and grits.  Both the beef hash and the benedict were just alright for my sister and I.  I've tasted much better of both dishes elsewhere and was super bummed as I was really looking forward to these dishes.If I ever go back here again, I am ordered the brown butter pancakes :)",Angelie A.

266,Alexandria,2017-07-22,syJHlTnHgGpXZDqEHpB2cQ,4, VA,"This review is based on two dinner and one brunch services.The restaurant is located inside the Park Hyatt near Georgetown. The entrance into Blue Duck Tavern (BDT) is through these subdued blue grand doors. The reception area is small and cozy. I was greeted promptly and the hostess walked us to our table. The dining room was clean, modern, and spacious. BDT has an open kitchen format which is a cool perk for those who are seated in the main dining room. Being able to observe the BDT staff prepare, execute, and plate every dish brings another dimension into BDT's dining experience.The food is served in family style manner and the portions are generous, which is an aspect I love about BDT. It allows your party to share and try everything. During our first dinner service, based on the recommendation from the staff, we opted for Wood Oven-Roasted Bone Marrow to start, followed by ""Braised Beef Rib"" and ""Moulard Duck Breast"" accompanied with ""White Corn Grits"", ""Hand-Cut BDT Fries"", and ""Oven-Roasted Asparagus""The bone marrow dish at BDT is very easily the best I've had so far. The spices and garlic brought this dish to life and made us longing for more. The bread that accompanied the bone marrow was crisp and well-seasoned as well. This dish is a must have for those who have not tried it at this establishment.The Braised Beef Rib cooked perfectly and it was moist and savory. Although I enjoyed this dish, I don't think it's something to write home about.The Moulard Duck is very easily the highlight of our experience. The duck was cooked perfectly. It was moist, flavorful, and delicious. The duck legs fell off the bones and melted in my mouth. The dish also came with this strawberry compote which brought some personality to the dish. The tartness of the compote combined with the ducks moist and savory features is worth experiencing.The second dinner service was for my little sister's birthday. Once we got to the table, we handed a personalized menu that read ""Happy Birthday"" on top, which was a nice gesture that added to our experience. During this service, we opted for the bone marrow to start. The restaurant also had a New York Strip special which we decided to try as our entree in addition to the Moulard Duck. One thing to note during this service was that it seemed like our food sat on the pass a little too long. When we received it, the food wasn't cold, but the warmth in our food was on the colder end. Our entree was accompanied with Creamed Spinach, which was delightful, and we ended the night with some kind of caramel-based pudding and that was magic in a bowl.Lastly, I recently came here with a friend for their brunch service. During the reservation process, I annotated that we had seafood allergies in this party. Once we were seated, we asked for recommendations. The server was already aware of the seafood allergies and began to recommend dishes that were safe not only based on ingredients, but also cooking processes that could lead to cross-contamination. Ultimately, we decided to share the Bone Marrow as starters (again), but this time the dish came with a lime that we used to squeeze on top of the seasoning which brought the flavors out even more! For our main course, we decided on their Coconut Macaroon Waffle and BDT Benedict. The waffles itself were crisp, light, and airy while the BDT Benedict was savory and well balanced in flavors.The service at BDT has been superb each time I've dined here. The servers are very attentive without being intrusive. The servers are very accommodating and it's clear that this establishment cares about the experience of its' guests.",Sam W.

They started us with a bread and butter basket. Delish. I wanted an order of fried green tomatoes as a side but it was suggested as an appetizer since the food would take a while to cook. Good choice. Came with a pepper relish and pimento cheese. Liked the relish. Not a fan of pimento cheese but bestie liked it. I ordered the organic chicken with eggplant caponata and a side of charred broccolini. Bestie ordered the duck breast with a side of mushrooms and spinach. All the sides are served family style. While I thought the chicken was a little salty, I still thought it was flavored well and it was cooked perfectly. It was moist. The skin was crispy. It was delicious. The broccolini was cooked well too. Very flavorful. Bestie said her food was cooked well and delicious too. Overall, very good choice in restaurant options and the service was spectacular too.

We ordered a whole duck for the table as our entree and we could not have been more pleased. The flavors were bold yet sweet and kept you going for more. We also ordered the one marrow as an appetizer. I was a bit apprehensive at first but I am SO glad I tried it. It was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten.

275,Westlake Village,2017-11-11,EqGJu5EDmhozHWRNNSMS0Q,2, CA,"This turned out to be a typical over priced restaurant located in a hotel. While the food was good and not exceptional, the portions were very small, which our server pointed out while we were reviewing the menu. The wine prices were three times retail. A Pinot Noir that was $60, retailed for $15. Additionally, when  paying outrageous prices for food, I would expect to have comfortable seating.  Not the case here. Hard wooden seats and sticky wood tables with no table cloths. I made a reservation weeks ahead and could only get a 9 PM seating. However, when we arrived at 7:30, they seated us at 8. Instead of being seated in the main restaurant area, we were seated at a table next to the bar area with people crowding around in front of us. When we finished dinner, we noticed the main part of the restaurant was not busy with many open tables. I complained about where we were seated to the hostess.

The main dishes were tuna which was perfectly done and the braised beef short rib that just melted in my mouth. They gave us complimentary side dish, charred broccoli.

278,New Orleans,2016-12-10,1mcv_FRCFgG5qASg9_aacQ,5, LA,"Turns out this place has a Michelin star and it's less formal than many which makes me even more of a fan.  The space is huge (separate entrance but connected to the Park Hyatt) and includes a large bar area with tables where you don't need a reservation, plus a bar that has 5-6 seats on each side, as well as quieter more traditional dining areas.  I sat at the bar, and was impressed with cocktails but especially the wine list - if you're looking for a great glass of wine to go with your meal this is the place to come.  Heavy on Champagne and well-made French wines which is rare to find.In terms of the food, portion sizes are medium to smallish and prices are on the high side but everything is executed perfectly with great ingredients and complementary flavors melded together.  I wasn't terribly hungry so I had a halibut dish that was interesting, very tasty, and just the right portion though it was pricey at $38.  The two women who were my neighbors at the bar had the bone marrow and a number of plates and liked them all, but ended up ordering an extra dish because they were still hungry.Don't expect to leave without a dent in your wallet, but if you're here definitely take advantage of the fantastic cocktails, wine, and food - even better if you're on an expense account.  A very well done restaurant though, especially given that it's in a Hyatt.",Brian C.

The large windows shower the whole restaurant in warm sunlight, and the open kitchen in the back is a delight to observe. Everything looks straight out of the pages of Bon Appetit magazine. The food is pricy but delicious. For starters, I shared the wood-oven roasted bone marrow with my boyfriend, which was salivatingly rich and flavorful spread over toast, along with a whole clove of roasted garlic, For the entree, I got to try both the short rib hash and the jumbo lump crab cake. The hash was just alright in my opinion. It tasted kinda like sweet and sour ribs, but more sophisticated. The crab cake was spectacular. It really blew every other crab cake I've had away and was definitely composed of at least 90% crab. Unfortunately, it was pretty small for $16. For dessert, we ordered the famous apple pie which was indeed scrumptious. The crust was buttery and flaky with a delicious, slightly burnt, caramel-y top, and the inside was ripe with generous chunks of apple. The two of us couldn't finish the whole pie and had to take it to go. BDT is a splurge, but I would say it's well worth it. Definitely give it a try!",Stephanie C.

The service was impeccable due 100%  to our waitress Gladys (Hispanic lady- noted so you can ask for her). I don't think I've ever had a waitress more polite and professional - if they have a position for someone to train others on customer service and professionalism - Gladys should be the person hired for it!! Our meal was tasty and when they took a few extra minutes for our order to be taken we were given a few extra treats. If you go I suggest the short ribs hash and spicy  chicken biscuit (sorry no pictures). The pecan sticky buns  are overrated - it was a table of 4 and we all agreed. Also the Dutch - style pancake was very mediocre (try something else). I would give the service  5 stars  and the food 3.5 stars 1/2 -- btw the food was light but filling.,Terri J.

We shared the market salad, scallop, pork belly, and a side order of brussel sprouts. The food was interesting to me because it had a nice balance of savory, sweet, and acidity. A lot of the (Asian-inspired?) food had an interesting vinegary taste that I usually don't find. My scallops were cooked perfectly and I surprisingly liked the horseradish broth. The pork belly had pickled carrots on top and were served with johnnycakes. Market salad was crisp, fresh, and had beautiful, vibrant colors. Brussel sprouts had little scoops of apples (I'm guessing Granny Smiths) that mimicked the look of the brussel sprouts. I really liked that bite of surprise. I love when you eat at a restaurant and become inspired to try it yourself at home. We will definitely try to replicate that brussel sprout.All in all, a great place to try.

Never underestimate a customer.If you like a snarky waitress who gives you minimal attention to questions about the menu, appears irratted that you didn't know what cocktail to drink at the moment she came to the table, takes your bread off plate away from you TWO times before you are finished eating your bread, brings out asparagus that is way over cooked, hush puppies that appeared to have been sitting out too long that they were dry and sea scallops that had too many conflicting spices with garlic that was SO potent it ruined the taste, you loved being rushed through dinner when the place is less than full ....Do you think we would subject ourselves to the offer of dessert ?If you are one that doesn't mind the service described and food less than par, then this is the place for you !",Rich F.

First of all, they printed a special menu congratulating me on my accomplishment, very nice touch. The waiter was super patient and accommodating with our group of 6 (when we were supposed to be 8 and there were two last minute no-shows- they were totally cool about it!). We ordered apps, individual entrees, shared sides, and shared dessert. The charcuterie plate app was very good, just kind of small on the portions, but as to be expected at a fancy place like this. I ordered the soft shell crab for my entree and it was delicious. The broccoli side dish, and pretty much all of the veggie side dishes, was amazing. We ended up ordering second orders of the sides cuz they were so good! And kind of small portions also- definitely not your traditional family style sides. The dessert was amazing as well! Overall, food is amazing, but smaller portions and expensive. But nothing out of the ordinary of a fancier Michelin star type place.",Christina R.

The drinks were decent but overpriced and took too long - service was unfortunately lacking. I expected more from a Park Hyatt and based on the other reviews - biggest food disappointment of my DC trip. Cherry on top was when they began to authorize my friend's credit card 2 nights later and never followed up when she called to ask what was going on. Spoke to another group who also went here for brunch and they agreed - overrated in a city with too many great options.",Michelle D.

298,Philadelphia,2016-05-23,Mk6Io5AAbbpy2WwiOnWk7A,5, PA,"I came to blue duck tavern to try some of their brunch items, sadly brunch is only sat-sun. We decided to stay, have lunch, and try their famous apple pie.BDT Reuben with BDT fries - best Reuben I have ever had! I am still drooling as I write this review. They toasted their bread like how a grilled cheese is made except it's a Reuben - totaly awesome! They are also well known for their triple fried duck fat BDT fries. I liked them, well salted, and soft/creamy on the inside. I think they could've been crispier on the outside though. Duck leg confit- duck was tough, not much flavor. Was disappointed considering ""duck"" is in their name.Apple pie a la mode for 2 - this is as good as everyone says it is. There is a crunchy layer of caramelized sugar on the crust that made it super amazing, and with the ice cream, it was the perfect combo.Service is also good.",Katina D.
299,Washington,2016-02-17,YUrJJl-yzlMgeJXqPKDgEg,5, DC,"Based on availability, we had a 5:30 reservation on a Saturday evening which was funny since when we got to the restaurant, there was no one there but it was totally fine nonetheless. The layout and decor is gorgeous with high ceilings and large windows. It feels enormous when you first walk in but it's actually intimate and cozy, and you're not directly on top of the other tables. Soon after sitting down, we ordered cocktails: an Aperol Spritz and the ""Tuileries"" which is pomegranate infused gin, sage simple syrup, orange bitters, and montfort crement. Our server, CW, helped me pick out a cocktail based on what I was in the mood for and my ""alcohol"" preferences. This was an excellent choice! Since neither of us had been to BDT before, CW gave us a helpful run-through of how the menu worked, dish sizes and different serving/sharing options. There was a Valentine's Day tasting menu also available that night but we decided to go our own route. Next to each menu item is the location from where the main ingredient was sourced. I love the focus on such fine, farm fresh ingredients from local vendors and artisans.  For food, we started with the charred endive salad and coffee-roasted carrot salad. Both were great but the carrot salad was definitely my favorite of the two. There was an excellent balance of sweet and bitter, crunchy and soft in this dish between the carrots, fennel and orange with the carrot ginger puree underneath. We took our time selecting the rest of our food and ordered our main dishes about midway through our salads. Neither CW nor anyone else hurried us along so we could savor one other's company as much as the food. For our main dishes, we ordered the tea-brined veal chop and roasted rohan duck breast. The veal was tender and flavorful, and the sweet potato mash was a wonderful smoky-sweet pairing. The duck was also tender and a nice crispy exterior, and the jammy, mustard-seed-spiked condiment (cranberry mostarda) complimented it well. Both meats were cooked perfectly. As for sides, we ordered the white corn polenta with Fiscalini cheese & charred onion compote and charred broccoli. The polenta was exceptionally creamy and smooth, not heavy or chunky. The charred broccoli was tasty and the pig ears, while we didn't eat them minus one or two, added an interesting textural component to the dish. Almost all dishes are served family style and each dish we ordered made for easy sharing between us. For dessert, we shared the caramel pretzel which was a wonderful combination of sweet molten caramel cake, dulcey panna cotta and salty pretzel ice cream. I'm not a huge dessert person but I loved the salty-sweet combination of this. The outstanding service, talented team of chefs, fresh and simple ingredients turned into masterful dishes, made for a wonderful experience.",Sarah M.
300,Washington,2016-12-22,2PKsUl8WBX-_s5TXmAZQZQ,5, DC,"Fantastic food with a wonderful ambience. I've lived in the Washington, D.C. area for ~5 years and can't think of a better place for a romantic date or classier outing. The menu is simple but the options are all far from that, and the waiters are very knowledgable about the menu. Everything tastes very fresh and presentation is beautiful. The duck is made to perfection with a nice, crispy skin. The sandwiches and burgers are also great for lunch options. However, you must order the duck fat fries (which is their specialty!), which are fried perfectly crispy on the outside and very fluffy on the inside.",David T.
301,Baltimore,2018-01-02,XHxiljbX8hkiFqYiyYGUlA,4, MD,I love this spot..the ambience is perfect..nice and warm feeling. I had the steak tartare as a starter and it was delicious..I mean i couldn't get enough. As my entree I had the duck breast and two sides...mushrooms with spinach and cheesy grit corn (something along that). The fuck is cooked medium rare so it's pink on the inside but tasteful. I didn't have room for dessert but next time I will definitely try to save room for it. Our server was amazing and attentive at times..it was a busy night. I would recommend this place for family or dates.,Britty-britt W.
302,Washington,2016-03-03,zhSJCySO5NX55W7u0-y7Iw,5, DC,"Cider-braised lamb shank. Sometimes you pay a great deal for a cut of meat and end up discovering that it is no better than more pedestrian preparations. This is not one of those times. This dish combines the natural savoriness of lamb with an impressive sweetness to create a unique flavor. As for sides: The wild mushrooms are delicious. The fried Brussel sprouts are also excellent and accompanied with a pleasant molten cheese. The apple pie at this establishment is justly famous, and is definitely sufficient for two people. The sugar caramelized on the crust perfectly compliments the sweet/tangy apples.Had the Duvel to wash it all down, which was fine. Although if BDT wanted to up their game, the beer menu might be the area with the most room to do so. Perhaps a dark Belgian or a doppel bock would help balance out all the hop-centric options.",Mike B.
303,Vienna,2017-07-04,fz3RkOe7w1ttqxujXheJGA,3, VA,"I had never gone to a Michelin-starred restaurant before Blue Duck Tavern, so my expectations were high. Maybe too high. I honestly didn't find the food that spectacular, it was just on par with other fabulous restaurants in DC (I ate at Brabo in Alexandria just a few days earlier, so that was probably my point of comparison). I had the pork belly, the braised beef, and the chocolate ganache desert. The Pork Belly and Braised Beef were good and plentiful, though not outstanding ""out of the world"" good. The desert was a huge disappointment, I really didn't like it. Service was also a bit disappointing, our waitress was professional but not outstanding. I noticed the other waiters and waitresses serving adjacent tables were much more gracious and offered better service than ours did. Although, our waitress did notice I didn't enjoy the desert and ended up comping it on the bill; that act alone earned her a nice tip, otherwise I wasn't planning to leave my usual percentage. Overall, I can say I finally tried a Michelin-starred restaurant. I wouldn't say that I won't return to Blue Duck Tavern, it's a good restaurant. But it's not one that I would go out of my way to visit.",Dhru B.

The service was top notch, our waiter made sure we had everything we needed and was really knowledgeable about the menu. He gave us great recommendations through out the meal, and went into detail about the specials on the menu. They have a great seasonal menu, so it's constantly changing with the season. We went over the summer, and had a great lobster salad to start- huge pieces of lobster!For my main course, I got the crab cakes, and much like the starter, it was filled with crab! My guests got the burger and scallops and both also enjoyed them. For a side, we got the hand cut fries, which were huge- super crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, served with a aioli sauceOverall, great food and service, with fresh, delicious food!",Katie H.
306,San Francisco,2017-04-01,vtuUuVjVDKrEi77oX-pwXg,4, CA,"We ordered the bone marrow to start, which in my experience was one of the best prepared bone marrow dish I've had. The dish was prepared with three large juicy and slightly baked bones along with four slightly toasted pieces of buttered bread. The highlight was definitely the garlic, which came seemingly in its original clove form but was roasted lightly so you can take individual pieces of the garlic smoothly with a spoon almost like butter. The flavors of the bone marrow along with the garlic and the bread were nice and I definitely recommend this as a shared starter. For the entrees, we ordered the New York steak and the duck. The steak was better than the duck and was really flavorful. The pieces were cut so you can see how the juicy red inside. The duck was okay - I would have preferred getting something else if I knew it would just taste like regular duck with cranberries on top (nothing special about the dish). For sides, we got the fries. They looked like giant cinnamon sticks on steroids or huge pieces of fried yucca. They tasted so good but there were definitely more pieces than we could eat by the end of the meal. It came with some type of spiced up house-made aioli sauce and complemented the potatoes pretty well. Also very good and attentive service.",David Y.

It was a birthday and the menus even had ""Happy Birthday"" printed on them and you can take one home, which was a nice touch.The atmosphere is ok - very chill and minimalist, which was fine. No tablecloths, which I think is a bit unusual for a restaurant of this caliber but not exactly a big deal. It's a bit loud in some areas so request a quiet table if you have trouble hearing and want to hear your companions. The service was very good, as expected. The waiter was very patient and helpful in recommending different items. The duck itself was excellent. I'm not a ""duck person"", but the flavor was truly unique - a rich smoky flavor with a somehow complementary fruity sauce. It was definitely unlike anything I had eaten elsewhere. I absolutely loved the soft shell crab, and I'm not a ""soft shell crab"" person either. I guess that's a theme here - outstanding meals that might surprise you.The dessert was good, but not my favorite part. The sour cream cheese was complementary because of the special occasion and was very light, which was nice and unusual for cheesecake. The butterscotch pudding was different in a good way as well. I would focus on the  other courses if you don't have room for three courses since the appetizers and entrees really stood out.I will have to come back and try more items on the menu since I really was surprised by how much I loved things I don't typically order.",Lizzy W.
309,Vienna,2017-08-07,hFTB0VU4zaxvPXaa-a-PCQ,5, VA,"Came here for dinner on July 23rd and loved everything about it. I should have known this place was going to be good as soon as they brought out a stool for my purse to rest on. Yep, a stool....for my purse!! I put my handbag on the floor when I arrived and next then I know, they are putting it on a stool for me. It basically had it's own seat at the table! Sorry if i'm focusing on this detail, but I've never been to a restaurant where that's happened before. As a table, we shared the seabass crudo, osyters on the half shell, foie gras ganache, and bone marrow for appetizers (there was 7 of us total). Two people at the table ordered the soup of the day. I think it was a chilled cucumber and avocado soup with crab. Everything was delicious, but the stand  out was the bone marrow. For my entree, I got the Seared Day Boat Scallops. I can't remember what everyone else ordered, but I know some ordered the special of the day which was Black Cod and the Lamb Chops. For sides, we shared the white corn grits, hand-cut BDT fries, fried green tomatoes, and roasted wild mushrooms. I enjoyed all the sides, but the standouts were the BDT fries and the roasted wild mushrooms. For dessert, I chose the Sour Cream Cheesecake. It isn't like your typical cheese which is kind of heavy. This cheesecake was so light and the perfect ending to the meal considering all the food I indulged in. Another person at our table ordered the butterscotch pudding, which also got rave reviews. I feel like you can't go wrong here. The bill came out to a pretty penny, but for me, it was worth it. I enjoyed every single bite that I had. Also, if you like drinks with a spicy kick, then try the Sancho's Boy cocktail!",Erica N.

Even then we had to wait another ten minutes. The food was excellent, but it was an awful lot of money to pay for terrible service from a Michelin rated restaurant.",Kristy Jo W.

Both were remarkly good. Fries were super thick but cooked well through, and went well as a side to a main meal. I was reluctant to try the bone marrow until I saw how it looked. It looked way too good to eat, and the taste definitely matched its looks.For main meal I had the duck. I was expecting the duck to be small portions but it was huge! Looking back I should have shared this. Our waiter said the duck is prepared we'll in advance so you cannot get it done medium rare.

313,East Bay,2015-10-14,0fmbIqn2yvQviP3MM2puKA,4, CA,"After reading through all of the Yelp! Reviews I just couldn't pass up bone marrow and foie gras.  As a tourist I was having trouble getting into the hot spot restaurants without at least 2 hour wait time.  Thankfully BDT was not packed and took my reservation. For the first timers, the restaurant is part of the Hyatt, but has it's own spot in the corner accessible from the street.  Dining rooms and patio seating with heat lamps and small water fountain.  Ambiance is amazing, service is outstanding, and the food is to die for!We weren't too hungry when we arrived so my friend and I opted for appetizers. We decided to take advantage of the nice weather and sit outside next to the water fountain.  Upon closer look, the ledge has plants, and they're mostly organic  veggies!  I saw lavender, chard, and peppers! It's an awesome concept that more restaurants should adopt.  On to the food:Fire roasted acorn squash salad - bay blue cheese, baby kale, apple cranberry, and candied walnut. This was pretty good.  It was composed of mostly kale with some squash slices but the cranberry and blue cheese really complimented everything.Roseda beef tartare - house made pickels, farm cheese, bdt whole grain mustard.  I'm not a fan of tartare but this was surprisingly good.  The presentation was awesome! And everything on the platter was tasty.Wood oven-roasted bone marrow - everything bagel crust and spring garlic butter.  If you're a bone marrow fan this is a must have!  The seasoning on the marrow was fantastic and the garlic butter? More like garlic heaven.  It was an entire piece of garlic roasted so you can get out the whole cloves. The only gripe I have is the bottom is lined with big salt pieces and if you're not careful a scoop of it can get into your food. Seared foie gras - blood orange jam and brioche French toast.  There is nothing short of amazing about this item.  The orange jam goes so well with the foie gras.  I could eat 20 of these without taking a break, even though I feel guilty for eating it.  This is a must have item when you're here.So I gave awesome reviews of the food I ordered and service but why only 4 stars? I thought the restaurant lacked on variety with their main plates.  I re-read the entree yet I couldn't settle on anything appealing to me.  I would rate this at 4.5 stars.  Will definitely go back next time I'm in the area and try other items.",Erica C.

My review also averages a recent dinner experience I had at BDT where I ordered the korean-fried quail.  While tasty, it was just a basket of fried with no accoutrements. My girlfriend ordered the tuna entree which included two tiny pieces of tuna.  The following evening I dined at nearby Honeysuckle and after that experience I would've preferred to have dined at Honeysuckle both evenings.",Vivi T.

Our server, David, recommended the whole duck special which he described in detail and the chef came out and presented the duck and explained the preparation process which was really interesting. We started out with the pork belly and bone marrow appetizers and the bone marrow was excellent. I've had bone marrow at other restaurants and they're served with a tiny spoon. Even with the tiny spoon, we couldn't get any marrow out of the bones. At Blue Duck, they gave us three big bones with plenty of marrow served with beef cheek topped with a barbecue crust, yummy. I thought we were done until my daughter discovered a ridge inside one of the bones that contained more marrow.For dinner, we also ordered the braised beef rib and salmon along with beet root gnocchi and brussel sprouts as sides. All were very good and tasty but the stars of the show had to be the bone marrow and the whole duck. The duck was succulent and full of flavor. The four of us couldn't finish the duck and David was kind enough to pack a container of sauce for us so we can enjoy the duck for several more days.For dessert, we had the panna cotta and chocolate custard which completed a great dinner. Before the check arrived, we were all playing a Price is Right guessing game on how much the duck costs. We didn't ask for the price when we ordered and the person who guessed the highest won.

We started off with bone marrow which was OK but again nothing I thought exceptional. We then went with the lobster bisque soup which came out luke warm and again nothing exceptional. I've had much better. For a main course I had the duck and my mom had the braised beef. Get the braised beef if you're deciding between the two. We also ordered the fries and the cauliflower. The cauliflower was very bland and we actually told the server her he was nice enough to say if we didn't like it we didn't have to pay for it so he took it off the tab. We finished up with the chocolate dessert again with the blah. The cake was dry and the ice cream was gross. The icing part was the best.

We ordered shrimp and grits, short rib hash, and a half order of blueberry pancakes to share. Brunch dishes, just like the dinner dishes I had few months prior, were beautifully presented and beyond delicious We were enjoying every bite until I found a blonde hair in my grit cake. Our server was apologetic and offered to remake my dish. I appreciated and accepted her offer.. But we were surprised when the check came that she still charged us full price for the dish. ""Hi I just ate your chef's hair?"" Not that we were expecting a free meal but remaking a dish that a guest found hair in it and charging full price... a sure way to drive customers from ever returning.",Wing C.

We arrived here without a reservation, fortunately we were able to get seats at their communal table which worked out because we needed the space to fill. Our server Kenneth was incredible, he made sure to take care of us and give us a tour, his recommendations and food knowledge was on point and truly made us feel at home. If you're looking for a good time with great food this is the spot, nice for a date but just as good for a weeknight meal. Thanks guys for a great experience.",Riko M.

328,Northbrook,2017-04-23,7h8cMNEu9igf9WNBwChmDg,4, IL,"It was my first time at this restaurant, despite just living across the street. We were seated right away, so it was nice not having to wait for our table. But we were seated at a table in a bizarre location- near the loud kitchen and bathroom. Chairs were comfy and the table was roomy, which is necessary because everything comes out on family style platters. My table had the charcuterie platter to start, which was delicious. The group consensus was that the chicken pâté wasn't the best, but we enjoyed everything else. We had the braised short rib, duck, and lamb as entrees, and shared the BDT fries and asparagus for the table. It was delicious. The three of us split the Apple pie dessert which was meant for two, but nevertheless was massive. We barely ate 2/3 of this pie and had to bring it home because it was so big. I gave this restaurant 4 stars because the location of our table made it difficult to have conversation, the lighting was terrible and we had to use our phones to read the menu, and the portions were too large to enjoy a full three courses.",Charlotte P.
329,Ashburn,2015-10-04,1BT3PXn7EsPMCHDIRgRJMw,5, VA,"Blue Duck lives up to its name. I can't thank the staff and kitchen enough for making my Birthday dinner a special one - thank you, thank you, thank you!""Don't worry about looking pretty while eating tonight. Move the plates around. Share the food. This is what Blue Duck Tavern is about.""And that's exactly what we did. No food was left without being shared across and around the table. We had forks flying to reach the last bit of meat, spoons picking up the last bit of sauces, and bread to dip into that soup you don't want to miss. It's a family dinner faire, and no one was left out.The dishes were all cooked to perfection - no complaints on most of it! Except for the chicken. Unfortunately, tonight's chicken was cooked to a dryer finish, but it could just be an off-night. To be honest, it didn't affect my overall impression of my dinner here.We were started off with a complimentary champagne to go around, and a nice bread to munch while we wait for our feast. To finish off, I went with the signature apple pie, complete with a candle. I asked for a side of ice cream, and they don't kid around. Our server came back with a glass TUB of the house homemade vanilla ice cream, slammed onto the rustic wooden table for that big finale.""Can't have the ice cream be overpowered by the magnificent pie, so we match up.""After a delicious, crips finish to our meal, our server took us on a quick tour around the restaurant. The interior design takes on a homage to a homey dining room, while keeping with a modern touch and functional flow. Anywhere you sit within the restaurant, you will have full view of the kitchen. I love that you can actually walk through the kitchen to go to the bathroom. Indeed, I feel like I'm visiting someone's home. Mirrors are placed in strategic places to help servers deliver food without knocking someone from the other corner.On the other side of the dining room, a mix of casual and business patrons sit around in the lounge area. We were informed of high tea hours in the weekends - a must if you're a fan of tea! Our server once again emphasized the great mix of crowd. Young, old, professionals, casuals, you name it.The focus of your Blue Duck experience is the people you spend your time with. The food is the tool, and the kitchen is the shop.",Santita N.

We started with mimosas and pecan sticky buns, the sticky buns being the best part of the meal. I had the fried chicken biscuit for my main course.

Tons of rich flavors throughout, with a homey/garden fresh tone (although way better than anything I would make myself at home or with my sad apartment garden haha). We had the bone marrow and duck, and for the sides we had sweet potatoes, cauliflower salad, and wild mushrooms. I was actually most impressed by the sides, as they were so rich and filling.

Our plan was dinner and then back to our hotel to meet the driver for the monuments tour we had scheduled at 9 pm. 2 1/2 hours for dinner should have been enough time.We started off with appetizers and champagne. Food was good and service was great. They knew we were celebrating a couple birthdays and we could tell they were really trying to make it special for us.Slightly disappointed that they were already sold out of the aged duck special. How could they sell out by 6:30?? But ok, we picked other options. We were a table of 4 and 2 of us ordered the braised beef rib and 2 ordered fish. And then we waited. And waited. And waited some more. Then the waiters began to avoid us because it was obvious the food was way behind schedule. At 8:15, we walked over to one waiter and told them we had to leave in 30 minutes so we could make our tour. At 8:30, our dinners are finally served. The fish was ice cold and both had to be returned. The beef rib was ok but there was no way it was braised 8 hours like they claimed, it was not tender and lacked flavor. So now we are waiting for the fish to come back out. You would think that since we had been there 2 hours before our entrees came out and half the food was cold, that they would put a rush on redoing the fish. And you would be wrong. It took another 18 minutes and again the waiters are pretending not to see us! The fish, when it finally arrived was warm but not hot and also very bland. But at least it wasn't cold. As we scarf down the fish so we can get out of there, we asked for the check. At this point it's minutes before 9pm and we have our tour. Could they just bring us the check so we can get out of there? Of course not! They wanted to give us free birthday desserts that we didn't ask for and didn't want. And insisted we need to try them when we needed to go. Seriously, it was awkward. We took quick bites for each and forced over our credit cards. Honestly, we should have just stood up and walked out. They did take the 2 fish entrees off the bill. I think they should have taken the other entrees off as well since we couldn't all eat our entrees at the same time. We didn't get out of the restaurant until a few minutes after 9pm. Fortunately the extremely nice and accommodating tour guide drove to the restaurant from our hotel and picked us up there. Extremely disappointing meal from the food, staff and how they handled the situation. Do not recommend.",Michelle M.

They are known for the duck, but I found the duck underwhelming.  We did love the beef rib however! It was delicious Apple pie was HUGE but so so good. We took some home.  The French fries were also really good, and I don't usually like thicker fries. Best thing on that menu for me was the mushrooms!!! They were exquisite and fresh and ughhhh to die for.  I would go back just for those.  I do remember the bathroom being like up an elevator and kind of far, so don't hold it til last minute.  All in all it was a great meal, but I am not sure it is Michelin star worthy... in my opinion",Charlie S.

360,San Francisco,2015-08-17,d4-3cVTFHoTqnC2Vi6Ixxw,5, CA,"This is for the Chef's Table experience. Kamal and his staff were beyond amazing. Service for the night could not have been handled better -- so much so that we voluntarily added another 5% to the 20% service charge. They brought out a shawl for my mom along with the hot water she requested without us asking for it. They were there and anticipated the guests needs. That's what I call impeccable service.Onto the food -- we opted for the four course meal ($100/person) and first three courses consisted of four dishes -- two mains and two sides that were served family style. We had 18 people and they served three identical sets so food was easily accessible and shared. Since it's the Chefs Table, you do not select the menu but will get the menu the night of the meal and the Chef creates a meal from seasonal offerings. The chef will come out when each course is served to talk about he dishes which we thought was a wonderful touch. You would think the amount of food would be overwhelming, but they know what they are doing. The sides were not overly much so we mostly finished what was presented and they lovingly boxed up whatever was still left for us to take home.Since it was a special 70th birthday party celebration, I added a cake which was $120 extra and boy was it an amazing cake! They brought it out for the happy birthday song then took it back for slicing and boxed the leftovers for us to take home. The evening could not have gone better. Seriously great space -- semi private so you felt comfortable enjoying the occasion with your family; attentive staff that paced the delicious meals just right (in between courses we just played musical chairs and caught up with those at the other end of the table); and fabulous food that even my picky Asian mom who usually avoids American cuisine enjoyed. Highlights were: foie gras, bone marrow, grits (wow, just wow), shrimp, pork and the cake.The only things to note are: it is a semi private room -- during most of our meal, the other large table was not occupied at the end of the room (it runs perpendicular to the Chefs Table room and it is situated on a lower level in its own space, but you can see about 1/3 of that table and here is no glass or any partitioners in between); however , towards the end of our meal during dessert, another party sat in the other room and it was definitely loud so I was thankful we were almost done but think if it had been occupied the entire evening, then perhaps the experience would not have been so lovely.",Stephanie L.

My family, boyfriend, and I made reservations to go to dinner at Blue Duck Tavern for my sister's graduation. My sister did her research, and when the time came, asked specifically to go to this to restaurant. She has impeccable taste.We were running about 15 minutes late for our reservation, but that wasn't a problem. Once we got there, the hostess greeted us with a smile and led us to our table. The table was in a nook of the restaurant, which allowed us some privacy, which we loved.Our server, Kamal, promptly came to our table and served us all water. While he was introducing himself, I let him know that it was our first time there, and that we were there to celebrate my sister's graduation. He was elated, and thanked us for choosing Blue Duck Tavern to celebrate the momentous occasion! Kamal walked us through the restaurant's menu in its entirety. He explained that the menu is divided into three parts. The left side is for appetizers, the middle section is for entrees, and the right part is for sides. Most people order their food a la carte, so we decided to do the same. For five people, we ordered the duck, chicken, salmon, and braised beef rib. For our sides, we ordered the asparagus, wild mushrooms, and duck fat fries.Literally EVERY dish we had was mouthwatering. If you go for dinner, you MUST order the braised beef rib and the wild mushrooms. I think both of those dishes are seared with magic. On to dessert. We ordered the apple pie, and when Kamal brought out our dessert, he also had a banana cream pie with ""happy graduation"" on the plate for my sister. HOW SWEET! She was surprised, and we were all appreciative that our server went out of his way to recognize her special day.The ambiance, the delectable food, the service - WOW. Five stars well deserved!

We asked another staff member to find our waitress, and it took about 15 minutes for a 3rd person we had never seen before to bring us our food.We also had to ask if our food was ready after waiting a really long time. Once we asked, the food came right out. At that time, we were watching our waitress chatting with a group of other staff. So, when the food came, it was clear it had been sitting out under hot lights for a long time, because the sauces had a film on top and the sunny side up eggs had a weird skin on them.It also took forever to get the check. Really, an odd service experience.",William W.

369,Washington,2017-02-28,F8VIaNv7sZ7MaRbdS2yXXw,4, DC,"I have wanted to try the Blue Duck since I first got to D.C. After having had a Michelin star and won the brunch award, my friends and I finally decided to give it a go. The restaurant is located in a hotel so we weren't very impressed by the decorations or the setting. For appetizer I would recommend the smoked salmon. It is paired with some purple potatoes and tasted amazing. The presentation was simple yet pleasing. However most of the choices for the starter were a little boring. The group then had the brunch burger, the short rib hash and the omelet. The fries paired with the burger were very interesting and the burger was pretty decent. The hash tasted great with a biscuit on the side and I would totally order it again. The omelet lacked presentation and had way too many mushrooms in it. For dessert we shared the apple pie with a scoop of ice cream. The portion was large enough for four and the pie was delicious. The only problem was that the ice cream was too sweet and I wish there could have been a twist in the classic apple pie. I think I would come back for dinner to try their duck but their brunch was just ordinary.",Christina S.

372,Arlington,2017-04-07,wIIbe7B1rKVPj6EDIVIXhg,4, VA,"I had heard so many great things about Blue Duck Tavern that I decided to go on a Friday night. Luckily, I had made reservations two days prior because the place was fully booked.The unique design and layout of the restaurant was the first thing that caught my attention. I loved how the kitchen and dining area felt like one space with how open and exposed everything was. Even walking to the bathroom and literally passing through the pastry station felt subconsciously forbidden yet exciting.The service was impeccable. Our drinks never ran dry and food came out with perfect timing and sequence. I even enjoyed the mid-meal wipe down of crumbs from the table.The meal was amazing as well. As our starters, we got half a dozen oysters and their famous roasted bone marrow. For our main course, we had the privilege of getting the second to last whole roast duck available that night, which we were told took 10 days to make and was served with a squash kimchi. Lastly to accompany the duck, we also ordered some roasted brussel sprouts.Oysters were sweet and briny. Perfectly paired with lemon and an onion vinegar sauce. Very good.The Roasted Bone Marrow was out of this world. Perfectly seasoned, melt in your mouth. The roasted garlic pairing was brilliant. I could also taste the Asian influence with their use of star anise. Bonus points for having an equal bread to bone marrow ratio.The Roasted Brussel Sprouts were okay. They were not as roasted and crispy as I was hoping for. The sauce garnish however was surprisingly tasty and gave the dish its salty note. I think it had crab roe in it.As for the Roasted Whole Duck...I really wanted to love it, but I really had a tough time pinpointing the WOW factor of the dish. Don't get me wrong though, the dish was very well executed. The skin was crispy, the meat was tender, but I wished the meat was juicier and the flavors were bolder. The squash kimchi also didn't do anything for me.Overall, my experience at Blue Duck Tavern was great. However, for being a restaurant with a Michelin Star and ""Duck"" in its name, it unfortunately left me expecting more.",Bryant O.

375,Seven Corners,2016-04-10,dLQQlw8O7u-27VBbs__6Mg,3, VA,"Very impressed with the chic interior and upscale presentation, but that's about it.A restaurant like this you would expect quality over quantity and are willing to fork over wads of cash, but the quality here didn't seem worth it to me. Really fancy... Sticky buns. Top of the line... Rib hash? Exquisite... Waffles!? Ordinary items at a high price that tasted... Well, ordinary. Is it really worth it? I'm sorry if I sound like a peasant, but I don't see the common sense here. The only thing I did love was the bone marrow which was worth the money in my opinion. Where do we draw the line between fine dining and cheap comfort food? I definitely understand the appeal and the likability, but this place isn't for me.And by the way, DO NOT do family style because some people won't show up and you'll have to pay for them and you will want to shoot yourself in the foot. $$$$$",Cee K.

385,Washington,2016-05-21,Ibo-UroTCSRhXzfRp5J2ZQ,2, DC,"Blue Duck Tavern is one of the most disappointing restaurants I've been to in DC. For one, the service was very unorganized and slow. It took 10 minutes before our waiter arrived to greet us. On top of that, the table next to us complained that they had waited over 40 minutes for their food. They later left in anger and frustration.After our orders were placed though, the food arrived very quickly. But unfortunately, the food didn't improve the situation. My duck was supposed to be done medium-rare. Instead, it was blue, meaning that it was practically raw!However, the raw duck was seasoned very well, and the puree potatoes were excellent.For a $$$ restaurant, the service and food better be top-notch.

Very romantic ambiance with dim lighting and open kitchen layout where you can see the chefs hard at work. I have no complaints about the food nor the service as everything was amazing from beginning to end. It's hard to list out what we ordered since we ordered so much, but the highlights of the night for me were the bone marrow, foie gras, brussel sprouts and collard greens. The vegetables were amazing, I don't think they have them on the menu anymore but if they ever come back do be sure to order them. I'm not the biggest fan of either greens but these were beyond amazing, lightly sweet and tangy, cooked to perfection!I would highly recommend!

387,Queens,2016-03-28,ArWl5_WUcQYasAs5P95sGA,5, NY,"What a beautiful, classy place.  The only downside was that I booked it almost a month earlier and I was only able to get reservations for 5:30pm.  But it's pretty self-evident why.The crab cakes weren't really anything to rave about and the roasted duck breast was a little too fatty for me, but THAT BRANZINO.  It's worth every penny and more.  It's an entire fish baked in a loaf of soda bread (which they remove, so you don't eat any of it) so it absorbs all the salty juices and they fillet it for you on the spot.  It went so well with the red pepper chimichurri sauce and I rarely, if ever, order fish dishes.  We cleaned the entire plate.We also ordered a side of the potato puree and it was heavenly.  So creamy and rich.The star of the show was the dessert though.  I know their signature apple pie is the most sought after dish, but we wanted something unique so we ordered the pear and cranberry buckle.  ZOMG.  It's like a cobbler with vanilla ice cream and streusel and chock full of fruit.  We couldn't stop raving about it, and we're still not done raving about it.Zaaaamn.  They know what they're doing.  Another must-try in DC.",Caroline K.

390,Washington,2016-04-03,bvevcGXZxzbgD-pS68-Lkg,5, DC,"My overall experience at Blue Duck Tavern was outstanding. I had heard mixed reviews, so I was a little apprehensive going in, but I was really glad I tried it out. Is it a bit on the pricey side? Absolutely. But it also is serving up decadent brunch, solid drinks, and delicious pies that look small but definitely should not be consumed by a single person (this is a lesson some of us will choose to learn the hard way). We made reservations on a Saturday afternoon with the explicit intention of splitting the 2-person pie. We figured we'd grab a quick lunch somewhere else and arrive around 2pm ready for dessert. But plans shifted and we ended up there for brunch as well. In all, we ordered the egg white omelet, the crispy brussels sprouts, and the polenta. While the egg white omelet was simply fine (meeting my expectations), the brussels sprouts and polenta were amazing. We washed it all down with a couple of bloody marys, which were also delicious. Spicy and strong (definitely with a kick of horseradish mixed in), these were no ""phoning it in"" V8-and-vodka-with-a-hint-of-pepper mixtures like you sometimes get. Along with the fresh bread assortment that came out (not to mention the toast that came with the omelet), this made for a pretty hearty meal, even for two people. When the time came, we decided we ought to come back another day to try the pie. This was a tough decision, as the pie was what drew us here in the first place, but we knew we were way too full. The part of our experience that really stood out was the excellent service, especially at the conclusion of our meal. Somehow, our waitress had sensed our burning desire to try the pie, and as a surprise brought out a mini apple pie to-go--at no charge! Sure, we had asked if they were still serving it just to make sure, but how she realized the extent of our yearning for that pie, I'll never know. All I know is that her ESPie, combined with that delicious pie itself, made this meal into a 5 star experience and ensured I'd be back for more dinners, brunches, and drinks.",Alan K.

Thankfully my girlfriend reminded me ahead of time to make a reservation for brunch otherwise it would have been all full.General:Beautiful decor and great atmosphere! All of the staff were extremely polite and professional. It felt like we were being attended to by the entire staff not just one waiter. We had a slight issue that we raised to the staff and they had it handled immediately. The best part was that they managed to find a good balance between attentiveness and hovering. It never felt like we saw them too much but they were there whenever we needed them.Food: Food was delicious. We had the fresh squeezed orange juice and the organic yogurt smoothie. Both were great, I'd highly recommend trying the smoothie if you get a chance.We had the bone marrow to start off with which was absolutely amazing. I only wish it came with more of that delicious crispy bread. For our entree I had the short rib hash. It was very well seasoned, not too salty but the sauce really made the dish. At the bottom there was a little bit of a kick from the horseradish sauce which really made the dish. The biscuit was good, nice and buttery but nothing else to say about that. The egg looked really fresh but didn't have a very distinct taste which I was fine with. Overall a great dish!My girlfriend had the lemon pancakes which were off the charts. Best pancakes I've ever had. They gave us maple syrup and we had a little laugh because she thought it was for my dish since she thought the pancakes were plenty flavorful already.Overall I really like what they've done here. They took ordinary comfort food and just gave it that extra level of refinement. Pricey, but definitely worth it. I'll be back!",Alexander Z.

395,Manhattan,2016-02-16,FaR_tqrrIcks7jqi8jwVCw,5, NY,"All week long, I heard the warnings: skip Valentine's Dinner out - it's a scam, waste of money, and bigger waste of time. But I had also heard and read the rave reviews from Yelpers and friends alike, plus we had missed out on Valentine's reservations here last year... so the boyfriend called a month in advance and snagged us a table for two. This year's Valentine's tasting menu, at $95 per person, featured four courses and an amuse bouche to start. Wine pairings were available for an additional $55, but neither of us were in the mood to drink that much so we passed. I'll start from the beginning: Blue Duck Tavern occupies the ground floor of the Park Hyatt near Dupont Circle in the heart of downtown Washington DC. Though we were told we could try to find street parking nearby, we opted to valet for $12. Honestly, the valet was the one and only complaint I had that night.. it was S L O W and disorganized. If you head in through the hotel's lobby entrance, it is a little confusing to find the restaurant. It has an open kitchen, so for a second I thought I had violated an employees-only zone. Thankfully one of the servers noticed our lost faces and directed us to the hostess stand. Although our reservation was for 7:45, we were pleasantly surprised that they already had a table ready at 7:15 to seat us. The ambience at Blue Duck is perfect. It is intimate and sophisticated, without coming off as snooty. It was refreshing to see that the tables were not all squashed together as in many DC/NYC restaurants, but rather spaciously set. Most diners were dressed in smart casual or a step down from cocktail attire. The noise level is busy without feeling like you have to raise your voice to speak to your date; the lights dim but not so much that your eyes are strained. Also, anyone who's read my reviews knows I love me an open kitchen - it always mesmerizes me to watch the process from prep to plate. Blue Duck boasts a wine list the length of a novella, but also has several solid cocktail and beer options as well. I am clueless when it comes to wines, so I asked our server for a recommendation. He was very thoughtful and took some time to determine my taste preferences before making some suggestions. My boyfriend got their take on the Moscow Mule and it was one of the best I've tasted (of course I had to sneak a sip from him!) We were worried that we would still be starving after the tasting menu, but the portions were surprisingly generous. There were also several palate cleansers throughout the meal which honestly tasted as good as each dish did. We were stuffed by the end of the entree, but were again surprised by a heartily-portioned dessert and two glasses of complimentary champagne.  I won't go into too many details regarding the specific dishes due to the ""special"" menu, but I will say that the quality of the cuisine and overall presentation were incredible. This is a meal I will remember for a long time to come - including each of its unique components. To top it all off, the service is impeccable. Our servers never once hesitated to clear an empty plate, refill a glass of water, or swap out silverware. They were attentive and always kept a watchful eye, without being pushy/overbearing or rushing us through any part of our meal. More importantly, they were so friendly and thorough in explaining each dish, down to the source and history of the meat in our entree. I always fear that coming to a more ""luxurious"" restaurant means hoity-toity service is inevitable, but that was FAR from the case here. Blue Duck Tavern was every bit as amazing as I had hoped it to be. It is a little pricey for our budget to be our new most-frequented restaurant, but I cannot wait to come back for the regular menu or even for brunch. Well-deserving of the praises that are sung.",Margaret Z.

They didn't have my reservation somehow. But they were able to seat me pretty quickly. (It probably helped that I was party of 1). I asked about bone marrow since I really wanted to have that but also wanted to have entree. So since I was dining alone, I asked about getting smaller portion of marrow and the waiter said they could do that but they brought me the full plate of 3 marrows.

We started off with the bone marrow and got a side of brussel sprouts. For our main dishes I got the moulard duck breast and he got the braised lamb shank. The servers were very attentive in filling our water cups and clearing our tables of plates. It took a while for us to get bread at the start but it was fine.Lets start off with the bone marrow. The portions were really big! Our dish came with 3 big bones and it had a good amount of marrow in each one. All the other places we've tried it barely had anything in them and we were just scraping at empty bones. The garlic it came with was really good with the bone marrow and toast. It added sweetness to it. The bone marrow had a five spice crust and the bottom of the dish was laid with salt so I'm assuming it was cooked in it because it was REALLY salty. I had to drink a lot of water that night.The brussel sprouts came with cured lemon and bottarga tonnato sauce. They were ok. I've had better elsewhere. They were described as crispy, but I did not taste any crispiness. I was not a fan of the cured lemon with the brussel sprouts. It was a little sour for my taste so I just ate around it.On to the main dishes! The moulard duck breast did not disappoint. I had it cooked medium per the server's recommendation bc I had never been asked how I would like my duck cooked haha. It was cooked to perfection, not dry and still juicy. I loved the cranberry mostarda it came with. The sweet and savory just balanced perfectly. My boyfriend's lamb shank was cooked well and it was super tender. It came with parsnip white chocolate soubise and caramelized apples. I wish it came with more apples bc I was not a fan of the white chocolate soubise. It wasn't sweet or salty, just bland. I would prefer the caramelized apples to be a bit more crisp but they just fell apart with no real texture. I ended up eating his lamb with the leftover cranberry mostarda I had from my duck dish :POverall, I had a good experience. I want to come try the brunch here one day.",Christina S.
399,Arlington,2015-03-14,BLy4K2B5vRDRYBcsJ7FnLw,4, VA,"If ever they're serving the hake, you have to order it! It beat the braised beef and bone marrow by far. Although I have to say, the bone marrow was the most memorable. Obviously there isn't much to eat from the bone marrow, but it's all about the flavor. Mind you- most of the dishes are infused with garlic, butter, and duck fat. No wonder this place is so darn good. For all the hype though, I wish the triple fries weren't so thick. I thought I'd never say this, but they gave too many fries. We decided to take the rest home, but of course, they weren't as good then. I'd like to try the crab cakes and scallops next time.By the way, we went for our fourth anniversary. When we told them that, they gave us both a glass of champagne!",Christina Y.

Wood Oven-Roasted Bone Marrow - Hands down, the best thing on the menu - maybe even on the planet! I love the texture of this dish and the seasoning makes it perfection. It was delicious! Must try at this restaurant. Roasted Rohan Duck Breast - I ordered the Braised Beef Rib my first time around and the duck was better than that dish in my opinion. The cranberry sauce adds a wonderful addition to the meat dish. It came with the duck breast and the duck confit. Apple Pie - It's definitely an expensive dessert but the crust makes it absolutely worth it! I think there's a bit too many apples, but that's just personal preference. The restaurant itself is beautiful and I just love the atmosphere. I would recommend making reservations (super convenient online). Plus, I can't say enough positive things about the service. Everyone was really attentive and wanted to make my dinner the best experience. The duck took a while to arrive (I barely noticed because I was enjoying the company and resting from the bone marrow) and the chef sent a free dish of mashed potatoes for the inconvenience.

Waiter: Neil Ordered: Braised Beef Ribs, Roasted Duck, Purée Potatoes, Grilled Asparagus Neil was extremely helpful with explaining the menu. Not only was he knowledgable of the items on the menu, but the farms where the animals were raised as well. Even after we decided not to get dessert he brought over a complimentary Raspberry Sorbet which was amazing. From the main course, everyone needs to order the purée potatoes (BEST POTATOES EVEERR). Out of the two meats, the duck was my favorite just full of flavor. The braised beef rib was cooked to perfection even after being roasted for 18 hours it still pulled right apart like a brisket. Overall, everything was exceptional and highly recommended.",Naomi R.

We also received excellent service, so overall, a success!I would've given this place a 5, but was incensed by how they charged me for the bottles of water that were left on the table. It is probably my fault for assuming that they'd be free, but I find it tacky that a classy establishment like BDT would do such thing. If I remember correctly, it was fairly expensive as well.When I go next time, I'll be sure to ask for the free water.",Ivy L.

410,Georgetown,2016-10-19,guwwsb98aV-ROj82Ouzs_Q,4, Washingto,"I've been coming here for many years, and they just got a Michelin Star. Upon my visit yesterday, we were quick to be seated. The decor is still beautiful with wide open space and many different table selections throughout the restaurant. They also have outside seating which is good for brunch...and they have a really good brunch at that.We sat near the kitchen, which is cool to watch, the only problem is you have so many people walking by you at all times, which could be bothersome. There was a woman manager at the computer station behind me and she kept staring at me while I was eating. Made me feel super awkward.FOOD:(Please note all the dishes are meant for sharing)*The Bone Marrow is fantastic.Cauliflower Salad- not that great- a little too spicy, rice was mushy and cauliflower wasn't crisp, nor did it have any flavor like the rest of the salad did. Tasted like it had been sitting and they put on a plate. *Pork Chop- cooked to perfection...best pork chop I've ever had!*Quail- Very good.Brussel Sprouts- Do not order these. They give you like, 4 brussel sprouts. (Waiter was kind enough to take it off our bill).Glass of 1986 BV wine from magnum bottle- $30 glass (thought the waiter said $20 or so) Not worth it. I've had waaaay better older wines. Waiter was perfect! He smiled and provided perfect service. On our way out multiple staff said have a good evening or good night or bye. Will definitely be back again and again.",Vivian L.

412,Washington,2016-06-14,md_rM82Qiz9l-Q0VYwiLzQ,4, DC,"My friend and I wanted to catch brunch on the fly and she recommended this wonderful establishment! Called to make a reservation, as most places in DC require one due to the the dense population. There is a stigma that comes with restaurants joined with hotels, but Blue Duck Tavern broke the stigma and I am a fan! When entering, the decor is beautiful with high ceilings, open kitchen, and natural lighting. Everything looks refreshed and welcoming, while clean, and modern. The staff is professional, friendly, and knowledgeable. I started the meal with a Bloody Mary (as always), and there is a standard I have with Bloody Marys that was exceeded. Ingredients like horseradish were fresh, and the drink definitely had a kick to it, Well made, and not too light or heavy with the vodka. The server explained that the menu is seasonal as they try to source local ingredients, so the menu changes with the seasons and demands. We order the smoked salmon to start. The salmon was perfectly made, without being too salty, and the creme fraiche was a good compliment. The dish also had a hash brown, and quail egg, I was hungry so I wish the portion was tad bit bigger, but a good starter regardless. Intrigued with the BDT Benedict, I order that as my entree. A creole spin on Eggs Benedict, it contained fried oysters, coleslaw, and Tabasco Hollandaise sauce. Oysters were fried perfectly without a fishy taste or smell (I can only assume fresh oysters were used), and the coleslaw/sauce complimented it perfectly. My brunch partner ordered the Chicken Biscuit which was a heavier dish, but just as tasty. It had collared greens, which I'm not a fan of, other than that, delicious. I would love to come back and have dinner here. Till next time!",Thoa Kim N.
413,Alexandria,2015-01-06,Ih3eRwovrng_NPBkaLLQZA,4, VA,"After being on my DC restaurant-to-try list for years, we were finally able to visit Blue Duck Tavern after seeing a film at nearby West End Cinema. I knew that the restaurant has a reputation as one of the better places to eat in the city so my expectations were sky high. I was not let down. The layout of Blue Duck Tavern is gorgeous, complete with a beautiful patio out front with mini waterfalls, fountains, and fireplaces. Inside, the space is enormous yet inviting. Whenever I make a reservation using OpenTable, I always request a booth for my husband and me. We were pleasantly surprised to discover BDT's version of a booth is a glass cube in the center of the restaurant. Yes, we were literally sitting at a table in an enclosed glass cube. While the table wasn't at a comfy booth, the experience of enjoying our own sort of private sanctuary in the middle of all the hustle & bustle was an enjoyable and unique dining experience.Now on to the food. I don't believe I've ever visited a restaurant and walked away claiming the soup was my favorite dish. Until now. And I don't mean that in a negative way at all. The roasted cauliflower soup was EXCELLENT. We also ordered the roasted cauliflower gratin & brussels sprouts to split, both phenomenal. Lastly, we ordered the pork chop and duck breast. Both were good but frankly not worth the high price (over $30 each). In sum, I was very impressed with our experience at Blue Duck Tavern. The service was very attentive and friendly, the food was excellent, and the ambiance was right up our alley. The only (slight) criticisms I have are that the service was so prompt that I actually felt a little rushed at times and that some of the menu prices were a bit high for what was offered. But I will definitely be returning to BDT and would recommend it to anyone visiting the West End of DC.",Judson W.

My bestie and I have decided to treat each other to a fabulous meal for each birthday...so he chose Blue Duck Tavern after doing some yelping. :)  When I say that I can't possibly find one single complaint about this place.  WOW! The staff is very professional, friendly, poised, and classy.  The whole way from dinner, I kept commenting on how much I loved the entire experience!Atmosphere:  Classy, luxury restaurant that doesn't feel pretentious.  Dimly lit.  it's attached to a hotel, so there were out of towners there.  Staff: As I mentioned, the staff is uh-mazing!  We had a reservation and as we were being seated, our hostess realized we were newcomers and she offered us the VIP seating right next to the open concept kitchen.  Our waiter, CW, even made time to check in with us and make a personal connection.  During dinner service I noticed that things were going soooo smoothly because it appears that each person on the staff has their own role... so that keeps them from stepping on each other's toes.  And it made service feel so seamless!Food: Y.U.M. The ""theme"" seemed to be classics with a twist...which I always enjoy.  I ordered the crispy pork belly and usually I'm on the fence with that bc sometimes it's way too fatty.  I don't know how the kitchen did it, but they got the skin so crispy. There was a tiny crackling on top of each piece of pork belly!  The sauce offered a sweet counter to the savory pork. OH! In getting to know us, CW remembered that I mentioned that we were out to dinner for a birthday. I'd already forgotten that, but by the time we ordered dessert, he presented it to us with a candle for my friend to blow out!  Awwww so sweet, right?!  Prices: It's a luxury restaurant.  You will pay.  BUT, you definitely get what you pay for!  I have zero complaints about this place and I look forward to visiting again!  Thank you, Blue Duck Tavern, for a special night.",Atiya Y.

The host staff was particularly kind and was able to seat us promptly. Our waiter was very friendly and was able to accommodate the dietary restrictions (1 vegetarian, 2 no pork). We were able to replace the pork meats on the cheese and charcuterie board. Their selection of cocktails was really good and the waitress provided additional details for each cocktails (little ingredients or infusions not mentioned on the menu). The fries were really good and the rest of the food looked really good (I couldn't eat it because I am vegetarian). I would definitely recommend this place for a dinner.

419,New York,2016-01-20,acdgymKRkWhuNvpiZjJ1YA,5, NY,"Amazing dining experience.Beautiful restaurant, friendly waiters. Immaculate (open) kitchen and flawless work flow as well. We had a reservation for 830pm one Saturday, couple of weeks ago. Took about 10 minutes to sit us. And then another 15 before the waiter approached us and took our order. We then found out that the blood sausage AND the short rib hash was taken off of the menu just less than a week ago. What a bummer after driving from NYC to try this restaurant. Anyway, 5 minutes after taking our order, the sommelier brought us the wine. We were so hungry! 10 minutes after the wine was served, the bread arrived. About 15 minutes after the bread was served, dinner arrived. We were just famished. You're probably wondering why 5 stars despite the hour long wait, the disappointment about the dishes we were so ecstatic to try and the 4-dollar sign price list? The food and everything else was that good. On our table:2 plates of bone marrowBraised beef ribWood oven fired steakHand cut friesPolentaApple pieThe chef and our waiter acknowledged the long wait for the food -they came over and brought a piece of truffle and shaved it on top of our bone marrows. OMG. What a treat.The bone marrow was perfectly seasoned; loved the touch of everything bagel crumbs. This dish was super indulgent, sinful and the best bone marrow I've tasted. I used to say it was from Le Philosophe in NYC. I've been to French restaurants that claim to have the best bone marrow dishes (simple dish that you could overdo) but this was just amazing. Braised beef ribs were as promised -wonderful sauce and tender (!) beef ribs. The steak was cooked exactly to the temperature we asked. It was a perfect medium. The temp, the flavor -impeccable.Polenta, we couldn't get enough of. Tasty and creamy with subtle grittiness. The hand cut fries. I had my doubts when I first saw how thick they were. I normally like my fries the usually size, if not thinner. The outer part was golden brown and lightly crisped and the inside of this block of a fry, was like the texture of mashed potatoes. I reckon they've been blended and then placed onto a mold and then baked to get that result... Lastly, the apple pie. If you've done your research about BDT you probably know that they're famous for this superb little dessert. Need I say more? Thank you to our server that night, I've forgotten his name (I'm so sorry) but I do remember that he introduced himself with just initials. like CB or something. All in all, this place is worth the visit and your money. We almost cancelled our reservation because of the food prices. Glad that we didn't.",Bianca S.

422,Springfield,2015-12-30,GzgdFhOmhXKud2KDuQXpmw,5, VA,"BDT will always have a special place in my books.  The food and service are consistently outstanding.  We always order the bone marrow and it is the best bone marrow I've had anywhere.  Perfectly seasoned, cooked, and served on a bed of salt rocks, roasted garlic, and toast.  If only there was a location in Northern VA I would visit more often!  The parking situation isn't great but we've always managed to find street parking.Recently celebrated our anniversary here and had the bone marrow (excellent), mussels (good), scallops (excellent), wild mushrooms (good but too buttery), hubby had braised ribs (good albeit salty) and hand cut frites (huge, more like a deep fried potato).  I didn't get the name of our server but he was Asian and was very nice, even gave us a complimentary anniversary dessert.   Definitely recommend for a special occasion or date nite!",Jennie S.

Not often do I have the opportunity to have meals like this, so right away the experience was awesome.  Disclaimer aside, the food and service were phenomenal. Let me lay it out for you: one bottle of VIrginia Cabernet Sauvignon; two starters of oysters (fantastic) and crispy pork belly (I don't love pork belly, but the crispy part was delicious); one entree Moulard duck breast with cranberry mostarda and one entree fennel-pollen and pepper crusted tuna with chorizo lemon garlic braised chickpeas with a shared side of asparagus with mystery sauce and crispy chicken skin. Our waiter also brought us a complementary side of braised fingerling potatoes with demi-glacé and onions, AND a complementary dessert of homemade sugar cookies and banana cream pudding ice cream. The finale: a ""fancy tea"" cocktail (whiskey, lapsang souchuong and elder berry) and an Evolution Lot #6 IPA.I know right? It's like written food porn. So how was it all? Amazing. It was truly phenomenal. The fennel tuna was a delicious combo, the asparagus with mystery cheesy goodness sauce was perfect, the potatoes weren't asked for and incidentally couldn't be eaten by my boyfriend (he's allergic) but were great, the sugar cookies might have been the best I've ever had and my Mom makes damn good sugar cookies. The fancy tea was super interesting, I might make it again myself sans elder berry, and John said the beer he had was great. But the best part of the entire meal was the duck. Oh my god, it was a revelation. I thought I didn't like duck, but I freaking love duck when it's cooked right and rare. It was seriously amazing.Quite possibly the best meal of my life, thanks Blue Duck Tavern!",Shauna D.

You better come here. While this place is on the fancier side... you definitely should come anyways. It's worth your money. It's on the expensive side... and I did come with my boyfriend on a gift card.... so maybe it was better because of that too... but really. come here to eat. Anyways, this is a dinner review: We started out with some drinks, appetizer, food, and got our dessert to go because we were overly stuffed.  Bone Marrow: Wow. I want to eat this again!! It was so rich and they gave you 3 bone marrow topped with great garlic-y seasoning. It also came with oven roasted garlic cloves that we were able to perfectly spread over our bread. This is a MUST HAVE. And for $17... I honestly don't think that is a bad price at all for bone marrow. Braised Beef Rib: Very rich. The beef was very tender and was so easy to cut into.... where you did not even need your knife! Sauce was good, but it was really rich, almost too rich for me. Roasted Duck Breast: I really liked this one.... the duck skin was perfectly fried and had a great crunch. The pear and fennel jam paired (ha ha) well with the duck and brought out the sweet and tenderness of the duck. Brussel Sprouts: Yes. Who can say no to brussel sprouts. Apple Pie: OH MY GOD. We ended up taking this home with us and heating it up in the oven. The staff was so sweet to even write on the box how we should heat it up. Which brings me to how friendly and accommodating the staff were. Our waiter was kind enough to explain to us any dish we had questions about and constantly came to check up on us.

Absolutely fantastic. Our server was prompt always filing up or drinks and very warm. What we ordered : Bone marrow - nothing but the hype for this. I couldn't swallow my first bite. It lacked seasoning and the meat itself tasted raw. I used all my bread for use with the garlic. Even my partner couldn't understand the hype of the bone marrow. For $20 it was most definitely a waste.Organic chicken - sadly, I couldn't even finish half it. Dry and bland. There seemed to be no salt in it at all. Oh and the leek surrounding it seemed like mashed potatoes. Again it lacked flavor. Pure disappointment. New York strip - seriously the biggest joke of the night. We expected a delicious looking steak and couldn't decide between this or the braised beef so when the server suggested, you'll love the strip period, we decided to give it a shot. When it came out of the kitchen, I actually started laughing. I felt bad for my partner because all he got was 4 slices of thinly cut tiny strip. For $40 I was wondering if it would fill him up! He said it was decent but nothing worth coming back for. Mushrooms - these were the stars of the night. Richly seasoned, we both ate every last piece and enjoyed every bite. Truly delicious.It is so sad to state that our trip here was the first and last. For $130 we had high expectations, but this was definitely a night we would easily forget. Many of my friends and family were excited to hear about our experience so that they could book reservations, but sadly they didn't get any positive feedback. I don't understand why so many people are over the moon about this restaurant. Yes the ambience is stunning and so is the customer service but I doubt you'd be willing to spend over $100 for these two alone.",A A.

433,Washington,2017-08-06,s2XuQanX_dEzQa0kT4AtTQ,5, DC,"Went here for a much-anticipated brunch, and it met every expectation we had. Food- Ordered the pecan sticky buns to start - WOW. They were so soft and warm, perfectly marbled with cinnamon and lathered in a delicious carmelized sauce.  Definitely recommend this as a starter to complement savory main courses.  Ordered the BDT brunch burger for the main, and it is highly recommended.  Open faced, so not too much bread to overshadow the perfectly cooked and seasoned burger patty.  I hate when burgers are loaded with too many toppings to mask sub-par-quality meat, and this one did the exact opposite.  The proportion of excellent quality beef to  cheese to butter pickles to carmelized onions was perfect.  And the dipping aioli was amazing! I didn't realize that their signature fries are so thick cut (kind of like giant potatoes rectangles), which isn't my cup of tea, but they were still yummy and I think would've been enjoyed by people who like potatoes.  Finished the meal with the butterscotch pudding which was a great mix of salty and sweet, and just very innovative with the salted marshmallows and tiny funnel cake.  Drinks-  Tried the berry and merry and the peach/bourbon based cocktail.  Both were delicious. The berry and merry was refreshing and light; a good summery brunch cocktail.  The it's just peachy was strong and tasty.  Service- Excellent. Everyone was composed, posh, and friendly. Ambiance- Huge, gorgeous, ample seating.  We called ahead to check what the dress code was for brunch and were told ""smart casual,"" which it was most definitely not.  Either they have to get more strict (my husband ended up coming in a button down and full pants but we sat next to men in shorts and jeans...) or not misinform clientele.",Monica A.
434,Los Angeles,2017-02-25,46saPTZI6wI_gxgHf-Jo3Q,4, CA,"Expectations are high when you know the restaurant has a Michelin star. I'm not sure it was so obvious based on our experience because even though food was good, there wasn't really a 'WOW' dish that made us really associate it as a Michelin star.. maybe that requires another visit and ordering different types of food.. like the whole duck that's slow roasted for about a week and priced over a buck? Here is what we ordered and some brief comments:Seasonal mushroom soup: creamy mushroom base with pickled garnish.. very tasty can't go wrong with this starter Bone marrow: I've only had bone marrow a few times and have yet to really understand it's hype.. maybe because it's a more acclimated taste? Overall good but not sure it lived up to the expectation the waiter built. I want to believe it was good though! Worth a try.. especially because waiter of seven years seemed to believe it was one of their best dishesBeef rib: delicate, melts in mouth, solid beef rib dish not much else to saySeared peppered tuna: this was not very good.. too peppery and I ate about half before deciding I didn't want to get full from itBrussels sprouts: good, seasoning not overpowering solid sideFries: GOOD. I may be biased I like potato anything but these fries are different. Almost feels like you're cutting into a slab of meat but the amount of deep fry and thickness would make any fry lover salivate. It is a bit on the heavy side.. but if you're feeling for special fries this is a good one Chocolate ganache: delicious creamy chocolatey richness without being too heavy.. the perfect ending to our very filling dinner Want to make a last comment that although we left overall content with the service we received from our waiter.. it was a special occasion we went for (boyfriends bday) and I had called twice to make sure they could help me make it special. They provided a customized dessert and also a customized menu.. but forgot about the menu until after we ordered. Minor detail and granted it was a special service provided courtesy of the restaurant... I just wish they had done it right from the beginning if they were going to do it at all (is this asking for too much..)It's located in  Park Hyatt on the lobby level of the hotel. Valet is provided at 12 dollars. ATMs available in hotel and supposedly garage parking around the hotel as well that the hostess claims may be a higher rate.

He was able to work with our large group and we had no hiccups.We decided to do family style for our group of 7 and it was a great decision. It kind of turned into a mini thanksgiving type meal. We got all of the following:Roast duck-- if they have it and you have a large group you should definitely get this! So flavorful and moist. Also the chef comes out and explains how they prepared it!Bone Marrow-- Another table favorite, the spices they put on it totally make itCheese platter-- Complimentary for my birthday and a great selection of cheesesHalibut-- Not my favorite but had some good flavorsQuail Brussel SproutsSweet Potato MashCornbread-- A must get! Crispy and butteryMushroomAfter all of this, we were all stuffed. Everything we ate was delicious and everytime we took a bit eof something new we couldn't think of anything else to say but ""SOOO GOOD.""They def deserve their Michelin star. If you have a reason to celebrate, I highly recommend Blue Duck Tavern.",Jessi N.

The chicken on the side of my salad tasted very unique, with different notes of spice and sweetness. Soup of the day was butternut squash, the best I have ever tasted.",Nghi N.
439,Columbia,2015-11-06,i1sM2j-7C-rXlNicV63a1Q,5, MD,Dinner at Blue Duck Tavern was truly a five star experience. We got there early and we had to wait but I was 45 min early so that was on me. They did end up seating us earlier than my reservation which was nice. Since this is a fancy place they are gonna get a fancy review. :) The lemonade was good. Not intense and not watered down. A nice compliment to the richness of the food. The sourdough bread with butter was good but I think it would have benefitted from being toasted slightly. The first course was the bone marrow. The word rich is not enough to describe this dish. It can feed an army and it's awesomely decadent. You have to try but maybe avoid finishing it all lest you be too full for anything else. Next up was the prime steak and the beef rib. The prime steak was cooked perfectly and was one of the most tender steaks I've had. The sauce is on the sweet side so that's up to your personal taste. The beef rib was so soft you don't need a knife. You can't cook it better than this. Also a sweet bbq style sauce. As a side we got the roasted mushrooms. They pair perfectly with both meat dishes. I almost prefer the mushroom over the sauces that came with the meat. But I tend to gravitate towards savory over sweet for my main course. Finally the apple pie. The crust is wow. I had given up on apple pie. No one seems to do it right. This was as good as it gets. Flaky and crispy at the same time. Sweet crust with a slightly tart filling which is how it's supposed to be. And the ice cream. I usually do not like ice cream. This ice cream will convert you. The spoon goes through it like a hot knife through butter. And the taste. Rich but light. Sweet but balanced. Pairs perfectly with the pie. Honestly the food is great but some of the things I would tweak for my own personal taste but that has nothing to do with the quality of the food. The quality is five star so that's what they get. And lastly the service. Also deserving of five stars. Our waiter was attentive but not buzzing around. Food came out promptly and with just the right amount of waiting. He was thoughtful and courteous and he sealed the fifth star. Final thought. Would I go back? In a heartbeat. I look forward to what seems to be an always changing menu so I can try something new every time.,Saif A.

The service is top notch, and the food is fantastic. I have had just about everything on the menu, and have thoroughly enjoyed it all. They offer good pricing, are open late, and provide generous portion sizes. In fact, I have dinner reservations tonight, and I'm looking forward to another wonderful experience. :)",David A.

442,New York,2016-10-08,PkgcKbkStiwD1ZXREd_l4A,4, NY,"Came here for brunch while visiting on the weekend. The service while we were seated was pretty good and friendly. Our food came out pretty fast and the staff was attentive in refilling our drinks. I got the BDT Benedict which was okay but would have been better if parts of it wasn't cold. My boyfriend got the chicken biscuit which he thought was pretty good. We also shared the BDT Fries which were different than normal because they were these larger rectangles with a orange mayo seasoned sauce which was surprisingly good. It was also cool how they gave us the entire coffee pot when we ordered coffee. One downside, which wasn't a fault of theirs but some of the customers were super pretentious. We came in early and had to wait until it opened which was understandable. When we came back to the hostess stand to be seated there was another couple there who just arrived. The hostess was about to seat us since we had been waiting when the guy was pissed and said they should be seated first since they had a reservation and we didn't. Honestly, it was no big deal at all. There were more than enough empty tables and it was brunch time. There also wasn't anyone else At the hostess stand and the dude literally couldn't wait like 1 minute to be seated. Also it's not like it's hard to get a reservation and that couple definitely did not look like they were any one important. Point is, they went ahead and instead of seating us they seated the other couple first. But like a second later they had another staff member show us to our seats. That I appreciated and understand that they were just trying to manage a difficult and overly pretentious customer.",Jen L.

The steak was extremely solid, which is unfortunately a rarity in DC it seems, however I was extremely disappointed with the bone marrow and some other items. The drinks seemed very good. The service was extremely disappointing, roughly 25+ minutes to have out plates cleared and the place was not at all busy. its not all that expensive and I would likely go back for drinks, but likely wouldnt do anything else but the bar.",Ruben G.
444,Rockville,2016-03-20,EMRNxyyA18nqpbflRjtnGg,5, MD,"This was one of the most pleasant dinners I've had. Not that I'm a connoisseur by any means.I came here with a couple of friends as a reunion dinner. We were seated promptly, and I was able to appreciate the open seating - in full view of the kitchen and it's comings and goings. Very interesting to see and hear the different dishes being prepared and plated.Menu is simple and easy to understand. We got between the three of us, the duck breast, lamb shank, and veal chop. All are solid choices, but my favorites I think were the lamb and the duck (after all it has duck in the name so it must be good). Lamb shank was cooked to perfection, nearly falling off the bone. Duck was rich without being too greasy. The sides for the table were the mushrooms and Swiss chard. I found the mushrooms very good, while the chard was just ok. Dessert was great - we ordered the salted caramel pretzel concoction, which while a little bit sweet for me (I like savory things), texturally was beautiful.Overall a great dining experience. If I make enough to be able to splurge, I'd come back here again. It's a good place for a date or a special dinner.",Brian L.
445,El Paso,2016-09-12,6NAJbP-_mGcukOCAa4Akxg,2, TX,"My husband and I are on a business trip in Washington D.C. and had scheduled a restaurant for each night we are in town ahead of time to ensure we had a place to eat that we could look forward to. I was running a bit late to my reservation so I called and asked if they'd be able to accommodate our table for 2 for 45 minutes later than our scheduled reservation,(5:45PM) I was promptly told NO. So I hurried to arrive and was 20 minutes late. Normally I would understand if they were understaffed or fully booked but the tables were mostly empty and we had no problem with the host upon arrival. So, I don't understand why they initially gave me such a hard time to change the reservation. Even after our meal, two hours later, lots of tables were mostly empty. To start, my husband ordered the bone marrow and it was great. I ordered the beef tartare but the mustard overpowered the plate. For the entree my husband had the duck and it was well made and delicious. I had the salmon and that was a BIG mistake. There was no flavor and the side of green beens, potato (again overpowered by mustard) was FRIDGE COLD. I'm not sure if this was a mistake on their part or if the sides for that dish were meant to be served cold. In retrospect I wished I hadn't lost a whole night at this establishment when there are so many great restaurants in DC.",Carmen M.
446,Boston,2016-12-25,2krf4u0Z_5vgZXx56aeNag,5, MA,"Went to Blue Duck Tavern for brunch on Christmas Eve with family. The ambiance was very contemporary and clean-cut. Overall, service was good. We had a waiter that made sure we were taken care of and got our dishes out in an orderly manner.  Below are the things we ordered and some cons. Apps:Roasted Bone Marrow - comes with roasted garlic, 4 slices of toasted bread, and three juicy halves of bone marrow. While the bone marrow itself was scrumptious, the garlic didn't have as much seasoning as I would have liked. This app is pretty steep ($20) but it is one of their specialities and I enjoyed it. Pecan Sticky Buns - I could not eat this (nut allergy) but the family seemed to enjoy it!Drinks:Sorbet Mimosa - I ordered a grape flavored sorbet. So they put a scoop of sorbet and pour a glass worth of champagne over it. So initial sips are straight champs but overtime,it gets more flavorful. Plus it comes with rock candy. Entrees:Sweet potato pancakes - this tastes like fall. And I loved it. It comes with little sweet potato chunks and with toasted marshmallow on top. I'm allergic to pecans so I did not have that. The maple syrup was organic and complemented the dish quite well. But I was def impressed and happy with this dish. Chicken Biscuits and Gravy - my sister ordered this dish and I had at least a quarter of it. The biscuits were nice and fluffy adn the gravy was given separately. I was happy they did this so that way the biscuit isnt completely soaked by the time you eat. Plus you can control how much gravy you want to add. Burger with Egg - my mom ordered this dish and it was large. But it is basically a beef burger patty with an egg on top (therefore making it breakfast). In addition, it had caramelized onions and brie (yum!). She also enjoyed it but since it was so large, it's a dish that can be split between two people.Muesli - my dad ordered this dish and said it was tasty and filling. However, the blackberries were not fresh, he says. CONS:-The coffee wasn't fresh! We would expect for such a fancy restaurant to have decent coffee. This coffee was def on par with Starbucks. Thankfully, the rest of the food was very good to offset this coffee-loving family.",Meera R.
447,Rockville,2014-10-03,0nP8V4v3q1YhZgSYPeifMw,4, MD,"My boyfriend and I decided to come here to celebrate our anniversary. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and she asked if we wanted to be seated indoors or outdoors. Since it was a gorgeous day, we had opt to sit outside to enjoy the nice weather and outdoor patio area. The service was excellent. Our waiter was friendly and was sure to check up on us every once in a while without being too intrusive. She even congratulated us on our anniversary throughout the dinner and made sure we were having a great time!For Dinner, we ordered:       *Bone Marrow - This was our first time trying bone marrow, which we ate by spreading on the complimentary bread. We had nothing else to compare it too, but thought it was a little too oily.       * Braised Beef - the sauce came out extremely rich, but the meat was soft and tender.       * Bouillabaisse - Just from watching Gordan Ramsey's show masterchef, we know this is a very difficult dish to make. It included one scallop, mussel, prawn, etc that we thought was very tasty. As this is an upscale restaurant, the dish portion was small, but very flavorful and delicious.Our waitress surprised us with a s'mores cookie (served with ice cream)for dessert to congratulate us on our anniversary! It was a great way to end the meal and we had a lovely time celebrating our anniversary at Blue Duck Tavern.",Ching C.
448,Washington,2015-09-17,VTeQ-Sn_-g3MCkD0FNy3sg,4, DC,"I stopped by Blue Duck Tavern again on an evening when we had some friends staying at the hotel across the street.  The flight was crap coming into DC so we were looking for convenience even though my brunch experience here was somewhat of a disappointment.  We were just stopping by for some drinks and a few apps and figured to give it a second chance.I must say the vibe after dark is wholly different than during daylight.  Instead of the zen/spa like feeling during the day it becomes a much more sexier place at night.  The lighting is low and everything feels much more sleek and upscale.  The tall ceilings and well laid out lounge area was aesthetically pleasing.I have been meaning to come by Blue Duck Tavern again for the bone marrow alone.  I mean I LOOOVE BONE MARROW!  There is plenty of hype around BDT bone marrow and I have to say, the hype is real.Four of the most massive cuts of bone come out sizzling from the kitchen.  The depth where the marrow lay is deep and for $17, I'd say the portion is generous (as far as bone marrow portions go).  The marrow is like meat butter and if you have not had a chance to experience it, please do, life will be better.While I generally enjoyed the seasoning on the top, my only gripe was that it was a little overwhelming.  Sometimes a food piece in itself is a wonderful, beautiful thing.  Seasoning should compliment.  Less is more.  I'll be back again for sure, I just know to ask them to go light on the seasoning next time.Our server, while nice, seemed a little new.  We asked for shots of Patron XO, which they do not stock. No prob, she offered some tequila, with some coffee poured in it.  Thanks, but I'll pass!!",Sylvie S.

Sunday brunch is a religion in DC and wanted to take moms somewhere nice. Blue Duck is located inside the Park Hyatt. Really beautiful hotel btw, wouldn't mind staying there...also, great lighting for taking food pics lol. Hotel restaurants are usually hit or miss and not my typical choice when visiting a new city but winner winner Blue Duck dinner? The menu changes frequently and they're all about that know-your-source/local ingredients life. Good idea to make a reservation. What she order:-Seasonal Sorbet Mimosas: strawberry & blackberry. Holy shit. I know $12 is steep and not bottomless, but truly the best mimosa I've ever had. Rock candy stirring stick to slowly melt the sorbet and add a hint of sweetness. Amazing!-Short rib hash: I like that they used sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes. Could've did without the dry biscuit. Incredible flavor from the tender/juicy ribs in combination with sunny egg and the sweet potatoes. 100. -French Toast: pistachio/marscapone/orange/chocolate. Perfect for sharing, the toppings were so good. Make sure to eat right away. -BDT Benedict: Solid fried oyster benedict, can't really go wrong here. Appreciate the giant oysters, no skimping. -Open-face breakfast sandwich: typical breakfast sandwich with egg, I think it had porkbelly, it was decent.Overall, everything we had was very fresh, well-plated, and delicious.

The service was fine, except we were there to celebrate an occasion and the waiter didn't ask so no complimentary champagne or dessert for us.Of course we ordered the bone marrow:  the mustard sauce was so completely overwhelming that none of us tasted the bone marrow. It was basically mustard+oil on very mediocre toast.Lobster salad: wasn't very fresh. The lobster meat wasn't sweet or tight enough.Blueberry duck breast/ pork ribs: two of the worst dishes of the night. The duck meat was mushy and pork chops well let's just say we left the place still hungry and boxed these two dishes for our dog.I was really looking forward to trying this place too. That and they didn't get our table reservation right.",Jane B.

The whole pieces of Apple in it plus the crust that made you think there was crack in the sugar! The Apple pie was so good we are still dreaming about it till now. The ratatouille was delicious if you love eggplant. My husband loved the bone marrow but I could  not accept what it was! The""fries"" were decent but aioli sauce with them were not. the braised beef was so succulent and tender that you won't need a knife. My husband had the duck and he seemed to love it.Everything is ala carte so be ready to pay a good amount. At least sixty a person with tax and tip. They have a huge drink selection and a mocktail section too. There is even a dessert wine for $1,200. They are amazing here in terms of service. The restaurant is located in the park Hyatt.  The valet parking is ten dollars. You are able to add it to your bill at the blue duck.

It was a more pleasant experience with the snow falling outside. I had the BDT Benedict. They must change up their eggs benedict dish often because I see different kinds of eggs benedict mentioned and pictured on Yelp but that particular day it consisted of pastrami, brussels sprout kraut (which is pickled brussel sprouts) and thousand island hollandaise which I thought was interesting.  It's not your traditional eggs benedict and I don't usually eat pastrami but felt adventurous so I went for it! It sounds like a weird combination but the flavors worked well. Probably not something I would order again though.The service was great. The waitress kept coming back to fill up the mugs of coffee even though the coffee carafe was at the table as well as making sure everything was okay.

We met for brunch as a weekend visit never allows for enough time to enjoy the travel as much as you want. Service was friendly, but maybe took some dishes prematurely without asking. (Is this fair to judge?) We would've like the bone marrow to stay on the table when our entrees came out. Especially with all the space we had. The short rib hash was lovely. Not sure if my mind messed with my stomach in preparation for the flight back home, but I got pretty full about halfway through my dish. My buddy, on the other hand, had the same dish and knocked down the rest of mine. Also, his Cafe Park (coffee cocktail) was absolutely lovely! That drink was clear winner (in my book) among our spread of mimosas and other cocktails we ordered. (Wooops. I forgot.) We were seated in the corner by the tall windows with so much natural light.

Very polite and welcoming greeter, clean layout and interior, calm lighting, great interesting food and good bar. The night we were there we sat on the patio where a small fountain creates a nice gentle sound of water in the background. But an hour into the meal it started raining. The staff was quick and efficient about relocating us to another table inside and offered a free drink as a consolation. Our entrée of roasted mushrooms was maybe too well done and heavier than expected but still quite good. The scallops were perfect but be wary: they only bring you 3 of them!!!A fried cauliflower dish was not to out liking but it was fun and we finished it anyway.

I wound up here on a ""proper"" first date with my girlfriend (now fiancée) and had a wonderful dining experience over dinner. The ambiance is nice, whether inside or out, the service is stellar, the cocktail menu is one of the best I've come across anywhere, and the food is superb and tends to be consistent. At BDT, the food is fresh and sourced from specific locations, and the quality is very apparent in each meal. The Chesapeake Bay, MD crab cakes are an absolute must, whether as a shared appetizer or as a main course for one. Though you can't go wrong with dinner, brunch at Blue Duck Tavern is definitely an experience worth having if you're in DC. The short rib hash is excellent, and the French toast is delectable. My recommendation would be to get a variety of dishes and share; trying to find the perfect balance of savory and sweet makes the menu worth exploring. The food at BDT is excellent, but the cocktail menu sets a standard of excellence. The Sweet Tea on the daytime cocktail menu is refreshing and unique with its blend of earl grey infused vodka, lemon, sugar, and soda water; I miss this drink a lot and can't wait to go back and order two at a time next time I'm back in town! The sorbet mimosas are also a nice touch, and the Bloody Mary is stellar as well. If you want a fun cocktail for day or night, try the Pomegranate Cloud. Overall, the food, drinks, and the excellent service make Blue Duck Tavern a can't lose selection. Highly recommended!",Danesh I.

I really enjoyed the breakfast buffet. It has everything I would want. I really like the European section which reminds me of hotel breakfast in Germany and Italy, and the hot food section is an eye candy to me with everything served in my favorite Le Creuset pots (and blue too!) For the service, the interior design and the ambience, I would give 5 stars.For the food, I would give 3.5 for dinner and 4 for breakfast.For the dinner, we had the following.* The complimentary bread - okay. butter was excellent though.* Olive Oil Poached Tuna - Nothing special. Tastes similar to canned tuna in olive oil.* Asparagus Salad - Interesting with coddled egg and guanciale.* Roasted Lemon-brined Organic Chicken - Very good.* Wood oven-fired Wagyu Beef - ""Is this really Wagyu?"" was my first reaction, unfortunately.

The ambiance was great from the start, though finding it was kind of difficult as the sun had set and their signage is very small. They managed to make it feel rustic and yet still modern which was nice. The kitchen is open to view which I always enjoy. We ordered a bottle of wine, which our server was very good (almost too good as my husband was DD) about refilling as soon as our glasses got even a little low. I really enjoyed the a la carte style here, but I think the waiter could have maybe given recommendations as to what would pair well. Here are some of the things we ordered: Beef heart: The meat was delicious, but there was far too much goat cheese on the plate. I ended up leaving a bunch of that behind. Overall it was a little salty. Parsnips: These were amazing, cooked in butter with oats and green grapes. I could have eaten just a giant bowl of these. Mushrooms: These were definitely the low point in the meal (in addition to dessert, which I will get to.) They were a little watery, and not as rich as mushrooms can be. Maybe they would have been better of one of us had had beef of some sort or even chicken, but I think either way they would have been a low point. Something about the way they were cooked gave them an almost spongy, canned-like texture. For my main I got the duck breast, which was delicious. It was a perfect medium-rare and the fat was rendered well. I've had a lot of overcooked duck breast at reputable restaurants so I was very pleased. The cranberry accompaniment it came with was perfect for it, though I wish there had been a bit more of it. I was a bit thrown by the inclusion of the confit leg with the breast because I felt obligated to eat it but it was very rich and salty, and because of the a la carte nature of the menu there wasn't anything on the table with the sort of freshness needed to balance that. My husband got the whole fish, trout I believe, and it was delicious. It came with butternut squash which was spicy and fermented, almost like kimchi. That was delicious with the fish and clarified butter. My husband loved it and he usually hates butternut squash. For dessert we got the ice creams, which were really icy and the presentation made them kind of hard to eat, so that was a disappointment. But we also got coffee (a cappuccino for myself and americano for my husband) which was strong while also being so smooth in the mouth. Overall it was a really good experience and I would definitely come again in another season. Hopefully they get the dessert kinks worked out, or it was just an off day there. I also saw that they had high chairs which I thought was nice, though I know some people don't appreciate children at nicer restaurants.",Caroline L.

475,Fullerton,2016-08-06,tRmkyPXOISx6eYzS7z_-3Q,5, CA,"Shoutout to Will for providing the best service I have ever had while dining. Will went above and beyond to make sure that I had an amazing dining experience; he answered all of my questions thoroughly, was incredibly friendly yet professional, and provided great food recommendations.My experience at Blue Duck Tavern was spectacular. I made a reservation for 5:30pm on a Friday evening and was seated promptly. The exterior and interior of the restaurant was beautiful and I loved how ""open"" the restaurant felt. When I was seated, I was given complimentary bread and some of their homemade salted butter. Now, a huge pet peeve of mine is when restaurants provide room temperature bread. I was delighted to find out that the bread I was provided was warm! I was given a couple slices of sourdough and multigrain, both of which were delicious.I had the pleasure of trying the following dishes:+ Wood Oven-Roasted Bone Marrow: Now, I had read so many raving reviews of this dish that I knew it was a must try. However, when I was ordering my meal I had asked Will if it was possible to order a half portion of some dishes because I wanted the opportunity to try multiple dishes. Will said that he would be able to bring out one bone marrow for me (the dish typically comes with three) to my delight. Imagine my surprise when he came out with the full sized dish, telling me that the dish was on him that night! The dish itself came with three slices of bone marrow, some white bread, coleslaw, and roasted garlic on a bed of sea salt. The white bread itself wasn't anything special, the complimentary bread given at the beginning of the meal was definitely better. I would recommend saving some of the complimentary bread to smear the roasted garlic and butter on! The coleslaw was very fresh and not too heavy--some of the best coleslaw I have ever had considering I am usually not a huge fan. The bone marrow itself was very fatty and is covered in BBQ spices, making it a salty dish. Eaten with the coleslaw and bread, however, balances it pretty well. This was a pretty good dish, but to be honest it wasn't my favorite of the night. + Goat Milk Ricotta Gnudi: Fantastic. This dish cane with three pieces of gnudi on a bed of mixed vegetables and and onion broth. The gnudi was cooked al dente and the ricotta and goat cheese filling was delicious. The onion broth and vegetables complemented the gnudi perfectly, I was tempted to ask for more of the onion broth so I could soap it up with my bread!+ Fried Green Tomatoes: I had no idea what to expect from this dish but I was blown away! Perfectly crisp, the sauces provided on this dish added an extra dimension to this dish that I cannot even explain. I loved the opposing texture of this dish and the gnudi--thank you again Will for convincing me to order this dish instead of the Charred Broccoli!I wish I had enough room in my stomach to order dessert, but unfortunately I was stuffed. When my check arrived, I was again blown away by the service when Will brought over some complementary Blueberry Sorbet and Peanut Butter Chocolate Truffles. Let me tell you, I am not a big fan of sorbets. But this Blueberry Sorbet was out of this world! If it is still on the menu when you dine here, please do yourself a favor and order it. The truffles were delicious as well--you can taste the care and quality in every single dish served here. I must have thanked Will at least a hundred times throughout the meal but here is another huge THANK YOU to Will, the chefs, and all of the staff at Blue Duck Tavern for making my experience unforgettable. If you are ever in the Washington DC area or have any doubts about dining here, trust me when I say that Blue Duck Tavern lives well up to its reputation is worth the visit! I look forward to dining here again when I am back in the area and will strongly recommend the restaurant to everyone I know.",Rachel L.

477,San Diego,2015-07-19,nIqdOKmDDzUjxwR48kY_pg,4, CA,"I came here for the first time a few years ago during restaurant week and wasn't incredibly impressed. However, a friend moved back to the area and really wanted to try BDT, so of course I was down to try it again since over the years I've finally learned Restaurant Week isn't so great after all...The restaurant decor is great- very interesting and different, but chic. The front door is freakishly tall haha. The bar area is really small and only seats about 8 people. The first time I was here, our group was sat in what was essentially our own private glass box. Which is actually better than it sounds ha. This time we were sat near the window by the kitchen. The kitchen is open so you can see them preparing all the dishes, and you can even walk through it. pretty cool. The service was great, and although I really liked our waiter, I had the hardest time understanding him. I am terrible with accents. Of what I could understand, we were completely on board with all of his recommendations. We started with a dozen oysters that were amazing and really tempted me to get champagne. Instead I got a red that ended up complementing our entrees well. We got the braised beef rib and prime steak. The steak was alright, but the braised beef was pretty much amazing. We ordered the mushrooms, which were excellent as well. I'll pass on the BDT triple fries next time, a bit disappointing. As if all that wasn't enough, we got the apple pie a la mode. I originally had my doubts about it, but it was delicious and totally worth the extra calories.",Jacinda T.

479,Washington,2017-06-03,LpMNlzZgDU8vJEvlaHZKsA,5, DC,"Blue Duck tavern is one of the most consistently tasty restaurants that I've been to in D.C. Their menu items are thoughtfully composed and presented and always so delicious! Their food is so good that I don't know even know what is best, although the bone marrow appetizer, the short rib entree, the potato fries side, and their apple pie dessert are definitely top of the list. The service is always impeccable and helpful - with the right amount of helpfulness but not too much hovering. Their breakfast / weekend brunch is also delicious! The fresh fruit and yogurt is surprisingly delicious, fresh and filling. Not only is their restaurant incredible but their catering service for events at the hotel is just as amazing! We had our wedding at the Park Hyatt hotel and Blue Duck tavern catered all of the food. The catering companies at so many of the weddings I've been to can't serve well cooked food to 200 people quickly and at one time. But our wedding food was absolutely delicious -- it tasted the same as it did during our tasting -- well cooked, absolutely delicious and served to perfection! We had compliments for weeks that it was the best wedding food they'd ever had! Blue Duck really earns their reputation as one of the best restaurants in D.C.!",Becky C.

STAY AWAY!  Buyer beware - check your bill carefully.  I won't get into how half the food was poorly cooked (half was great), nor how they couldn't get our order right (poor service too).  What you really need to watch out for is the server charging you for food you didn't order, then when you ask to talk to the manager, Haikki (but we were lied to about everything else so we were probably lied to about the co-managers name too), will magically bring you the correct bill without even talking to you.  How did the co-manager know the bill was wrong?  And why wouldn't he even talk to us to understand what was going on?  All he said before walking away was ""I was told to bring you your check."" then he turned his back and walked away.

Hype.Normally am not a fan of paying an extravagant amount for dinner (or anything), and have been known to bash over priced placed before (*cough* Cedar *cough*) but this place was worth every penny. Celebrated a birthday here this past weekend and was blown away by everything....literally. Everything. We originally had reservations for inside but found it was was a little too cold for our liking. The staff was extremely accommodating in finding us a table outside, despite how busy they consistently are. The staff was incredible with every one of their recommendations and I'd make it a point to add that all of their cocktails are very stiff - wasn't expecting to leave with a buzz so + 2 points for that. You've read this 100 times by now too butt the bone marrow is hands down one of the best apps I have ever had in my life. Legitimately the best. No seriously...the best. It was like a meaty butter. Go get it now. The main courses were good but it's the staff and overall experience that gives this place a 5 star.

484,Philadelphia,2016-12-18,1jgVFWlluUW_TNlRAUrP4g,5, PA,"Blue Duck Tavern is absolutely fantastic. I had the distinct pleasure of dining at the Chef's Table, and the semi-private nature of the room was perfect for our event - a capstone dinner to a conference. There are wine racks along the entranceways into the room, and the ambiance of the rest of the restaurant filters into room, but there is enough separation to feel like we were getting a special experience. The waitstaff were extremely professional and friendly, and the food came out in a very timely manner so we weren't bored waiting in between courses or even getting started. Chef Brad Deboy came and explained some of the techniques, history, and planning behind each dish, which provided a nice, personal touch to the meal.We had a pre-set three-course menu and were treated to some of the restaurant's most lauded dishes, such as the bone marrow and the 45-day dry-aged ribeye. Both were delicious, and we also had the duck breast - which came with ample portions. The appetizers included the cauliflower salad and the poached pear salad, which were simply divine (but I'm big on vegetables, so perhaps a little biased) as the dressings and ingredients all worked well with each other and had the perfect texture for keeping the palate light. There were some seafood dishes that were not as memorable, and the desserts weren't particularly innovative.I can't wait for the next opportunity to return to Blue Duck but am uncertain that an a la carte dinner will live up to the singular and magical experience of dining at the Chef's Table.",Angie R.

Best part was the mustard seeds.The beef tartare - tasted bland, the crab cake had no salt and flavor. Was not seasoned properly.I'm giving this 3 stars because the apple pie was amazing (get the kids version for $5 and it's a really good size) - we shared it and still didn't finish it We also liked the broccolini - which we could make at home but it was very good. Just garlic red chili flakes and a lot of butter and olive oil. The bartender was cool - she wasn't very experienced - also the pastrami sandwhich was good! Would not come here again though",Nisha K.

We went there for brunch and ordered smoked salmon, bone marrow, chicken and biscuit, beef burger, crab cake, Brussel sprouts, apple pie, hand cut fries and chocolate ganache. My fav is chicken and biscuits, they are just so simple but so good, very flavorful. You can see why they win Michelin one star.

488,Miami,2016-07-06,kfRSOFFu5ipedHtPi09SxA,3, FL,"Because it is Washington D.C. which seems to be a foodie's nightmare due to lack of restaurant options and variety I am giving this place 3 stars. If it were in any other city I would give it 2. Overall, we were very disappointed in the food and service in D.C. For a major city we were shocked by the lack of restaurants in general. We were in town to celebrate my husbands birthday and after doing extensive research and not really finding any restaurants that really stood out to me I settled on this one. They made a special menu for my husband for his birthday which I thought was a nice touch. Our server was good which is something rare to find in D.C. I found the menu to be limited and I wish they had more options especially in terms of appetizers.  We both ordered the steak entree and got the fries and cornbread as the sides. My steak came out at room temperature and I had to ask them to heat it up. They fixed it right away but this is not something that should happen at a fine dining establishment. I found the sauce that came with the steak to be overly salty. The fries which are more like a hash brown were delicious and probably my favorite thing.  We did not care for the corn bread as it was overly greasy and lacked flavor.  For dessert we got the strawberry short cake which was pretty good.Decor is traditional meets modern and I like the open kitchen aspect so you can see everything they are doing in the kitchen. Kitchen is very clean and nice. One thing they need to improve is the seating. Chairs are wooden with zero cushion so it feels like you're sitting on a church pew.Overall, we had a good experience. Were we blown away? No.",Nicole H.
489,Silver Spring,2016-08-08,Z0FHAGDpFA4Fpou48dZ4Vw,4, MD,"We have been here a couple of times, most recently for Sunday Brunch. They have a pretty nice brunch menu with savory and sweet selections. We started out with the fruit plate which had a great variety of seasonal fruit (berries, melons, oranges, etc). We also got the bakery basket - on this I would pass next time. It came with a oatmeal mini muffin which was very flavorful, a chocolate croissant, and a plain croissant - neither of which was remarkable. For our main courses, my husband had the short rib hash with a soft egg on top and lots of meat inside, this was a filling choice. I had the fried chicken biscuit. This was also served with a sunny egg, tomato jam, and braised greens. The first few bites were really good and a nice mending if flavors, but maybe I didn't eat fast enough because the chicken skin started to get soggy and then the dish wasn't nearly as appetizing. The coffee was really good, French pressed brew, and I thought it was a nice touch that they brought us fresh cups in to go cups to take with us.",Jessica N.

491,Washington,2015-06-05,D-jXAqTQI5aBdqS0FCKbDA,5, DC,"I had a very unique dining experience at Blue Duck Tavern.  A group of friends and I visited on a Friday evening to celebrate our friend's birthday.  There were about 7 of us and they were able to accommodate us outside on their lovely patio, right next to their multi-tiered water fountain.  Everything seemed perfect, but about 15 minutes into our stay there, the fountain started overflowing!  Yes, overflowing.  Onto the ground around us.  It didn't stop for 2 hours.  I'm not even exaggerating when I say that.  I'm not sure where all that water was coming from... but the fountain was overflowing for 2 straight hours.  Thankfully they had a drain on their patio, but the place was quite literally flooded.  Thankfully, we were on slightly higher ground so most of the area beneath our table was fine.  My shoes got a bit wet, but it was OK overall.  Overall, it was mostly amusing to us.  They had various engineers attempt to stop the fountain and finally, after 2 hours, they were successful.  After the fountain stopped overflowing, a duck (which the waiter said was a regular visitor at the fountain) came by and sat on the fountain for about half an hour.  It was fortuitous that we saw the resident duck, given the name of the restaurant!They were very gracious and apologetic about the fountain mishap.  They offered us a free bottle of champagne, which we gladly accepted. They also gave us a complimentary charcuterie board - very delicious slices of meat!  We all ordered the same cocktail - a seasonal strawberry drink.  Tasty and refreshing on a hot day!  Their dinner menu is nice and it was honestly very hard for me to choose what to order.  I ended up doing something I hardly ever do at fancy restaurants and ordering their chicken entree.  I figured that the place is called Blue Duck Tavern, and though I don't like duck, I would order something similar.  The roasted organic chicken I ordered was DELICIOUS!  Perfectly tender and juicy with a tasty honey glaze on top and all on a bed of braised cabbage.  So perfect, and very filling despite the appearance of a small portion.  We all ended up getting sugar cookies for dessert as well.  Tasty!The ambiance is classy and intimate, but also great for groups.  The service was impeccable throughout.  They were truly apologetic about the water fountain mishap and brought out towels for our feet too.  I would certainly visit again - the hilarious water fountain incident does not deter me at all.  But I think I would prefer sitting indoors next time, just to get a different experience.",Pegah Y.

It has a bar/lounge as well as a restaurant area. There was a wait for the restaurant so my friend and I were seated in the lounge. The decor is contemporary yet classy. I was enjoying a nice evening with a couple of friends, but I definitely felt like many people were here for business meetings or on romantic dates. The food was impeccable. The menu is quite extensive. My friends ordered the Soup of the Day - tomato and beet soup. It looked very rich and creamy. I didn't try it but both of my friends were very pleased. For myself I had the braised beef rib sliders. They came in three pieces - they were just the right size. The buns were a little sweet. The short ribs were cooked perfectly to medium rare. They were incredibly tender and juicy. Oh. My. Goodness. My mouth is watering now just thinking about them. I liked that the food wasn't too heavy, so we still had room for dessert and drinks for the rest of the night.The hostess and our waitress were very professional and attentive.

We went for desert and were placed on the side (in between the restaurant and hotel) I specifically asked for a candle or something for my boyfriend, as it was his birthday. The woman said that she would tell the waiter and after waiting about 15 minutes, he finally came, took our order and failed to follow up with the candle.Other than that, for the different times I've done dinner (when I think far enough in advance to make reservations) I haven't been disappointed by the high quality food. Great place to take business meetings, birthdays, and/or dates. Just whatever you do, please make sure that you get the apple pie. The first time or two I was told to do this and ended up getting something else (not the biggest fan of apple pie), then one day I did order it and have dreamed of it ever since. It's AMAZING and big. You can easily split it between two people or order it for one person and then have plenty of left overs.

Pancakes were fluffy, served with berries, creme, and some crumbles. Service was excellent. For dinner, we had the bone marrow (a tasty and unique experience but not necessarily one that I would rush to do again), crab cake (good but not memorable), duck breast (quite good) with mushrooms, vegetables.

The only time available was 8:45 so word of advice, book early!Knowing how pricey this place was and unsure of the portion sizes, we actually snacked on Ben's Chili Bowl before heading here, which in retrospect, was a good idea. The portions aren't huge, especially considering the price. However, the food is delicious.We shared the duck with crispy confit skin and the special of the day, which was a rare seared tuna dusted in black truffles. We also ordered the wild mushroom side dish. The duck was tender, though, because duck is so rich, we probably should have ordered a more vegetable-y side dish. The sauce on the duck was delicious and the skin was nice and crisp. The tuna was my favorite though. The truffle dust was amazing with the fish. The mushroom side dish was also delicious. There was a variety of mushrooms and I'm pretty sure I had one or two morels, which are one of my favorites.Though the portions weren't giant, we weren't able to finish our meal because it was a bit heavy so we asked our waiter to please wrap it up to go and we skipped dessert, as nothing on the dessert menu really wowed us.The service is great - our water glasses were constantly being refilled - and the atmosphere is v. cozy and romantic.",Rach K.
504,Washington,2015-05-17,S9pCkD1LmbelTG2SY2Ab7g,2, DC,"I had waited years to finally come to this place. We finally found a reason to come and celebrate my brother's birthday. Reservations need to be booked early, I was able to snag a 530 pm reservation on a Monday. My family treked from the region to come celebrate here. When we arrived at ~530, our table was not ready and we were told to just wait in the corridor. There wasn't really that much space to stand or sit. So we awkwardly just stood right next to the super long and tall main door.We were seated at the raised level in the middle of the room, far away from the floor to ceiling windows. It was quite dark at our round table. We got a partial view of the open kitchen, but could not really see the action. We were served immediately, and it took awhile to order our food. It was nice that we had to servers to our table, perhaps because we were larger. We tried ~8 dishes and were gifted a free pea shoot appetizer salad which became one of my favorite dishes that evening.The bone marrow was good and decadent, and a nice fun way to start a meal. We had an assortment of the entrees, and I was expecting it to be a little bigger plates since yelpers and the staff mentioned it was meant for sharing, but really one plate was  portioned smaller than a main entree at most restaurants these days. Since each entree is around ~$30, I almost felt you need to eat 1.5-2 entrees per person to be full. I got the special of the day, catfish, but that was really disappointing because the fish was so small, and hard to share. We also ordered the rabbit pasta, which was pretty tiny portion and barely any rabbit. Was not a fan of the fried chicken quail. Was not expecting it to literally be deep fried full of batter, and less of the quail flavor. There were lots of misses for the food. Since we were celebrating my brother's birthday, my brother had showed his ID when ordering drinks, and told the server it was his birthday. It was a odd response, when the server responded with ""Oh really,"" and then left to get his drink. They didn't do anything special for him. It was a pretty unmemorable food experience, and I probably would not return, and definitely not for celebrating any special occasions.",Jess C.

Blue Duck Tavern provided both of these. The unique menu forced us out of our comfort zone a little as I ate bone marrow for the first time. Pleasantly surprised, this appetizer set the tone for the entrees as unique food with sophisticated flavors. Now, when our entrees came out, the food was slightly cold. However the staff did a wonderful job of fixing the issue in more than one way and talking to us personally on the matter. The restaurant's reaction makes me believe that the cold food was just a mishap and that the staff knows how to interact with customers. I definitely recommend this restaurant for dinner if you are in DC!",Kyle S.
508,Palo Alto,2015-07-07,BK9mu62LJTV_0cu-FukLqA,5, CA,"Wow! I've been dying to try this place and happened to make it in for lunch with some friends on July 4th.Our server, Gil, was awesome--super friendly, attentive, and patient. I don't usually include decor comments in my reviews because I don't find it relevant to my food experience, but the decor here is a really cool, eclectic mix of kind of rustic country (e.g. rocking chairs) and super modern chic (glass, laminate). It works really well and is elegant and understated. They also have two ducks currently residing in the pond, which is just too cute! Apparently, they just showed up a few weeks ago and have decided to make Blue Duck their home. Too good to be true.The food was amazingly good! We had the bone marrow to start with (thanks Yelp!)--easily one of the best things I have ever eaten in my entire life. The seasoning on it is perfectly strong and flavorful without overwhelming the delicate texture of the marrow itself.For my main course, I had the duck confit. It was also excellent! It comes topped with a strawberry balsamic glaze that helps balance the richness of the meat. The summer squash vegetable mix accompanying it was sooooooo good as well. I wanted seconds of my veggies!My boyfriend and friend both got the braised beef rib, which is marinated for an unholy number of hours (something like 12 or 16??) and then cooked in their wood oven. SO. GOOD. The texture was incredibly tender and juicy and the sauce/jus it comes in is so, so good.To finish, we split an apple pie. The pastry crust was super flaky and buttery--definitely one of the best pastry shells I've ever had (including France)! The pie filling was also great, but not quite as out-of-this-world exceptional as the outside.Already planning on when I can go back!",Veronica L.

And, if you do not have room for desert, make sure you ask for the sugar cookies! Our dining experience was made better by the attention of our server, Michael Hillman.

Anyway the Short Rib Hash was the best I've had in the country to date. It'll be hard to top moving forward. Horse radish underneath with a very well diced amount of short rib, combined with perfectly seasoned and diced potatoes. The short rib was so tender and flavored so well I just kept eating and eating. Every bit was as good as the last. The egg was done well and the best part with the yolk exploding always makes me happy inside. Compliments to the chef on this one. Impressed beyond expectation.

I had the escarole and beans (the veg here is outta this world!! Don't ask me if it is truly vegetarian cause I don't care - it is usually awesome!). The escarole and beans needs a bit of tweaking. Too salty and - unfortunately- gritty!! Gotta wash them greens if you're gonna serve em. Seriously - I know y'all get snobby about the salt but trust me - too much. The garlic was amazing but i couldn't finish the dish cause of SALT. But that said thank you for a beans and greens dish - I added your stellar corn bread (with its hint of porky funk?) and a glass of the French rose - good stuff.,Nurse J.
520,Alexandria,2016-08-23,Asv4WzDuTsj0-B9KLr4p5Q,4, VA,"I was excited to try this place.  I had heard so many things about it that I had to see for myself.  I went for my birthday dinner, definitely a special occasion venue.  It was a Friday night, did not have a reservation, but arrived early enough to make sure that we could get a seat.  I was disappointed as the restaurant never filled to capacity despite how hard it was to find a table using the Open Table app.  The serving staff was polite and helpful.  I was feeling chatty myself and the serving team kept to the business at hand. I first took note of the wine list and cocktail selection, because it was a long day.  The cocktails were creative, playful, healthy and refreshing.  I was not planning originally to order wine, but when I heard the offerings told to the table next to me, I could not resist.  The wine list failed to disappoint; proving to be wide reaching, expansive, and covered the globe. Be advised, it is an a la carte dining experience. I had the Tidal fish special.  While the fish was cooked a bit more than I would have liked, the sauce the chef created was exquisite; a bounty of Asian inspiration that pleasured the palate and soothed my soul.  The temperature in the restaurant was on the cool side.  The environment however, was warm with open kitchen allowing patrons from both the hotel and restaurant to view the edible works come alive via the various sous chefs at their work stations. The work stations were clean and you wanted simply to pull up a chair and watch the menu items come to life.  When you go, be sure to walk around and take in the splendor that is the Blue Duck Tavern.",Nicholas K.
521,Fairfax,2014-02-06,Ex9r5L9ueCJI7EAI1ud_qw,4, VA,"I came here for brunch with my boyfriend and really enjoyed the meal. The restaurant is very nice, love the interior. It's very spacious inside and the kitchen is front and center with a wood-burning oven, inviting all to see the chefs work their magic. Rustic wood tables create a warm and contemporary environment. There's even a spacious outdoor terrace for warmer days. The restaurant is located in the Park Hyatt and offers regional fare created with seasonal ingredients. We started off with house-made wood-fired pecan sticky buns and I ordered the eggs florentine which consists of spinach, pork belly, and choron sauce. Everything was very fresh and flavorful, plus local! On the menu, it said the pork came from Eco-Friendly (aptly named!), VA. Other items on the menu that sounded good: roasted tavern steak and eggs, crab frittata, crispy skin salmon, chilled lobster salad, etc. They also have housemade hot biscuits served with DUCK GRAVY, veggie selections, wines by the glass, and fruit and vegetable juices. For dinner, they have wood oven-roasted bone marrow and seared foie gras, which sounds so delish. This place not only serves great, local food, it also beckons with its cozy elegance and top service. I also love their business card. It's square with a dark blue background and their duck logo on the front and Blue Duck Tavern printed on the back. So simple and perfect for a duck lady like myself!",Alice W.

We were crunched for time so we figured we'd stay here anyways as the menu looked good & the decor was well kept. First let's start with the server, Michael. Accommodating and attentive, Michael heard our interest in a bottomless brunch spot & suggested a few to us that he recommends. Not only this, but while dwelling over the menu, my friend had asked about the chicken sausage gravy appetizer. My friend opted against ordering it, but as we waited for our food (which took a bit longer than expected) our server gave us a small sample of the chicken sausage gravy with biscuits. Also as a courtesy we received desserts with mango pineapple jam(s) which were delicious. All of the food was to die for, even the food on the house that we didn't order. While I expected small plates & large prices, which is typical of upscale dining I was impressed to be filled & satisfied once the bill came. It should also be noted that our server noticed that a burger wasn't ""medium"" and had a new one out to us in minutes. Brilliant service and the food was delicious. Highly recommended.

526,Bethesda,2014-06-23,d_3X6rEnT7FsrlG_IWQbXw,2, MD,"I went back to Blue Duck Tavern for friends bday. I was kind of excited to give Blue Duck another chance, because even though I remember they had a weird way of billing me, I remember the food being mostly good. Well this time to my disappointment they changed to their summer menu. The best thing I got last time was the Brussels sprouts and they didn't have it. I also remember the foie gras being amazing, but this time was their summer version and it was not tasty. I felt bad because I kept raving about it to my friends who came and no one ate it after tasting it. I ordered the chicken in a lemon brine with the garlic confit and I thought that was the best dish of the night. Everyone else's dish was just ok to me. The ahi tuna was a tiny proportion and I'm sure that was around $35 dollars. My bf got the braised beef and he liked it, but flavor wise to me it was just ok. I tried a piece of someone's suckling pig and I still thought it was just ehhh. Honestly the best thing was my chicken and that was one of the cheapest entrees $28! We ordered a bunch of sides and they were all average. The duck fries that I enjoyed so much last was just ok to me this time for some reason. I was excited to try their apple pies for dessert because it looked amazing and it was not good. The apple pie was dry and had no gooey-ness. It just seemed like sliced apples stacked together in a crust with barely any spices and seasoning. I was so disappointed! The service was sooo slow. We had a big party and we were seated at a private dining table. We had 1 waiter and the dinner was over 3 hours. It took forever to order apps, entrees, and dessert. The waiter left too much time for us to linger. The bday girl already chose the sides ahead of time so I don't know why the dinner lasted as long as it did. Everyone was decently on time and we all had chosen our entrees quick. Putting in the order was another story. I appreciate our waiter gave us privacy and didn't rush us, but it was to the point where I felt like, ""where the heck is he so I can put in my order"" haha. He was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu.   In the end we were given complimentary cranberry white chocolate fudge and that was delicious! Super sweet, but tasty!I can't comment this time about the billing since the bf took care of that. But overall I was even more disappointed then the first time. It's way too expensive to give it a third go around. I'm pretty sure I had a Blue Duck Tavern experience and it was not for me.",Annie T.

529,Vienna,2016-04-07,pePbnXqVXCuL5GnjZcaoqQ,5, VA,"There are few things T and I enjoy more than treating ourselves to a nice dinner out. Living in Vienna, we usually tend to stick to restaurants around our neighborhood due to the sheer convenience of it. We have also had our share of one too many bad dinner experiences downtown and have since been quite hesitant to go out our way to dine in DC. We always hear about certain places that we definitely must try from friends and coworkers and Blue Duck Tavern has been recommended more than once. So, this past Tuesday, we were more than thrilled to finally select it as our date night dinner spot. Was it worth the hype? Well, let me just  say we are still thinking of our dinner that night!Before I get to the part about the food, I feel I must first clarify how confusing the entrance can be for first timers. Blue Duck Tavern is located in a pretty confusing way inside/next to the Park Hyatt right across from the Fairmont in the glitzy West End. After leaving the car with the valet we wound up walking into the Hyatt since the restaurant entrance wasn't clearly marked. The entrance into the restaurant from inside the Hyatt also isn't very obvious and we walked around looking around for it until we awkwardly walked into the kitchen. We were then guided out and towards the hostess who was standing on what appeared to be a far off corner in front of a nondescript reception area. Our reservation was for 8:15 but the hostess told us that our table wasn't ready yet and escorted us the their neat bar area. The walk over was also a bit confusing since there seemed to be a lot of odd narrow passages between large spacious dining rooms and glass enclosed private dining areas. When we were finally seated, the layout finally began to make sense. The centerpiece of the room is the awesome open kitchen where you can see and hear cooks bustling about and carefully creating and decorating the plates promptly to be served. The dining area does a good job of creating a balance between being spacious but also cozy. The tables are spread out enough that you still feel a sense of privacy but the dim warm lighting and the dark oak and wood tables make for a rustic and tavern like ambiance. The service was pretty impeccable. Our server clearly explained the menu to us and made some great recommendations. I started off with the Maine Scallop Crudo and T got the Baby Farm Lettuce Salad. We were both pleased with our choices. The crudo was very minty and light and delicate and the I thought the trout roe was such a nice addition! The little eggs would burst in my mouth in sweet little pops! Delicious!For the main course, I decided to try duck for the first time and T got the Braised Beef Rib. I was a little nervous about not liking my meal but I was very pleasantly surprised. Our meals were served family style which was convenient and made it easy for us to share. My Roasted Rohan Duck Breast was probably the best first duck experience I could've had.  The meat was rose colored and tender with just the perfect amount of juiciness. The smoky tasting sauce paired nicely with the subdued sweetness of the strawberry mostarda and complimented the tender meat very well. I actually found the duck slices to be a little chewy and didn't enjoy them as much as the perfectly tender and juicy meat on the leg. T adored his Braised Beef Rib.We were told that it was aged for 18 hours and the results were phenomenal. The meat was so very tender and soft and oozed with the steak sauce when poked with a fork. We topped it all off with a scoop of chocolate ice cream for me and the Guinness chocolate brownie for T. Even though we were stuffed, we devoured our dessert. That chocolate ice cream scoop was seriously the best I have ever had! Despite the amazing meals and friendly service, Blue Duck Tavern wasn't very expensive. I think it certainly helped that we only got one glass  of red wine for me so the price can go up if you get more alcohol. All in all, we walked out very satisfied and felt like we were celebrating some special occasion even though it was an ordinary chilly Tuesday evening after a grueling day of work. We'd absolutely love to come back, especially for special occasions. The only criticism I can think of is the rather confusing entrance but it did not deter from the rest of the dining experience at all. This is an upscale and sophisticated dining space that leaves you feeling like you just had a very special dinner at a friend's house!",Maria K.

532,Brussels,2015-03-21,NuBDZOhZOpTbQVmR6Qy94A,2, Belgium,"I had been wanting to try Blue Duck Tavern for a long time, but unfortunately, I found it rather disappointing. Service was lacking when we needed it and overbearing when we didn't.  I started off with a gin fizz, which was pretty good.  I liked the free bread and soft butter they served at the start of the meal, which was probably the high point of my experience at the restaurant.  For my entree, I got the classic mussels and a side of brussels sprouts, which the waiter recommended.   The sauce for the mussels had good flavor, but the mussels themselves didn't taste fresh at all and were of poor quality.  About half of them were really stringy and rubbery, by which I mean I tried to pull them out of their shells with my fork, and they stretched and wrapped around the fork several times before coming off the shell.  Needless to say, those weren't enjoyable at all.  I was hoping the server would come by to ask how we were enjoying the meal so that I could send it back, but he came back until we were ready to get the check.  The brussels sprouts were good, pretty typical of what you'll find at many DC restaurants.Since this restaurant is so famous and highly rated, I'd probably be willing to try it again someday, but I wouldn't order any of the items I tried this time.",Nadine F.
533,Washington,2015-06-23,gP59tYuefGDJtWrLhkrjAw,4, DC,"The Blue Duck Tavern is well-reputed in the area, and rightfully so - but there are some rough corners to this place.The Blue Duck Tavern is technically two places: a casual area for sitting and drinking, and a formal restaurant.  It's VERY easy to get lost between the two, and you can very well find yourself accidentally walking into the open kitchens if you are not careful.  Signage, suffice to say, would be helpful.  The design is excellent, and rather nice, though perhaps a bit simple and unsurprising for D.C.  Prices are high, but not exorbitantly so.  Service is slow and a bit odd at times (feeling either weirdly oppressive or completely absent), but decent nonetheless.I tried the Braised Rabbit Tagliatelle, the Roasted Organic Chicken, and the Roasted Wild Mushrooms.  The Rabbit was SUPERB - while the noodles themselves were nothing to really call home about, the sauce and liver mousse was simply phenomenal.  The portion size was small, but rather filling given the quality.  The Chicken was good, albeit not nearly in the same class as the Rabbit.  The Mushrooms were also superb, and were perfectly seasoned overall.  I also note that the bread was excellent.The Blue Duck deserves its reputation - I just wish the dining area and service were a hair better.",Kirk S.

Their popular dishes definitely lived up to the hype and I hope to try one of the seasonal specialties next time. We we especially impressed with our server's extensive knowledge on wine pairings. He was a grad student who had only recently started at BDT, but knew every dish on the menu and could articulate which wine at all different tiers would go best with each.

Started with a lovely bottle of wine of there somewhat brief but well varied list. They bring fresh bread over as well, a house made multigrain. Had to fight myself to only eat one piece. For an appetizer I had the creamy squash soup (made without cream) which was absolutely delicious.For dinner I had the suckling pig (sorry lil guy) which was simply amazing. So tender, so flavorful with a crispy skin and just the right amount of fat to give it flavor. Served with some uber fresh and perfectly cooked vegis of the season. What a terrific meal.For dessert I had the apple pie sundae. Which was too very good, but I'm not a big dessert person so I can't rave over it. Service was spot on.

It's like the feels, but for food.Located adjacent to the Park Hyatt and across the street from the Fairmont in upscale West End, Blue Duck Tavern is a classy restaurant with an open kitchen concept, and organic American fare.When you walk in, the restaurant gives off a cozy tavern vibe with the bar displays and seats tucked away in various locations. The open kitchen concept is a big draw as you get to walk thru the kitchen and see what's going on! I loved it. If you look at their menu, you can see where all the food is sourced from - much from nearby.I've been twice now - once for my birthday dinner and another for brunch. I must say both meals were equally amazing.Definitely make a reservation. When my boyfriend and I went for dinner, our waiter was very attentive and recommended the fat fries (huge fries) - amazingly delicious. I got this amazing cauliflower soup with scallops and trout roe on it --- it was divine and right up my alley (and it was two months ago and I still remember!)I ordered the rockfish and my boyfriend got the duck. Along with our fries, we also ordered a side of brussels, and the waiter brought us some white corn polenta on the house! At first, we thought the portions looked small, but we couldn't even finish everything! The presentation was magnificent and it tasted even better. For dessert, we got the nutella breakfast and they brought out the pretzel ice cream on the house! Couldn't have asked for a better meal!BRUNCH---DC is a big brunch town, and if you are looking for a FANCY AF brunch, look no further - definitely rivals the Four Seasons brunch (was that blasphemous of me to say?). My best girlfriend and I came at the tail end of brunch (1:30p) and ordered mimosas - if you think you'll get a regular mimosa here, you're wrong. We had PASSION FRUIT SORBET MIMOSAS - what does that mean? A gladd of prosecco, with a scoop of passion fruit sorbet, and a rock candy stick.I got the baked eggs with tomato and eggplant, and crispy parmesan and my friend got the short rib hash. I stole her biscuit w/ my eggs and it was a good choice. The tab ended up being $127 - we each got 3 drinks. So, you can definitely keep it on the lower end if you don't drink that much. Definitely coming back next weekend!TREAT YOSELVES!",Norah C.
537,Baltimore,2015-03-16,JMjogNfOGB3TdIKb4qbLCA,5, MD,"I went for a birthday brunch with friends on Saturday morning and was wowed with the ambiance and service of Blue Duck. Located in the very chic Park Hyatt, the restaurant melds in with the minimalist, serene Japanese decor of the hotel perfectly. You walk through the open kitchen on the way to your table, which kicks off a 5-star experience from start to finish. I'm personally not the biggest brunch fan as the offerings tend to be the same everywhere you go (omelets, eggs benedict, pancakes, waffles), but Blue Duck stands out with its locally sourced, farm to table ingredients. Yes, it's one of those places, but it actually has the service and class to justify the higher prices. Our server Michael was exceptional--very professional (they all wear suit and tie), polite, and friendly. We ordered the orange beignets to share, however, he came out with a complimentary order of the signature Pecan Sticky Buns for us to try. When it came down to the food, I would recommend the sticky buns, the open-faced breakfast sandwich (delicious housemade sausage on top of delicate pear compote topped with a runny egg), and the short rib hash (exactly what our server recommended). I was disappointed with the Pumpkin Pancakes as they were very one dimensional and bready, not soft and fluffy. When our food came out, I was also surprised when Michael brought us additional complimentary sides including the brussell sprouts and the thick cut french fries (kind of tasted like yucca fries), another extremely generous gesture on behalf of the restaurant for my birthday. Brunch entrees averaged $15-20 whereas appetizers sides were around $10 each, but you get what you pay for. Our bill for 5 came out to be around $120, however we were spoiled in that we didn't pay for much of what we received! Even on a student's budget, I would not hesitate to return for a special occasion or treat--Blue Duck Tavern is really on another level.",Y J.
538,Denver,2014-04-28,7mRmf6UlqfRhAx_gEF5Kcg,4, CO,"Tip: make a reservation.I'm glad I made a reservation before coming here. We arrived and there were about 5 parties waiting for a table. The 4 hosts looked like chickens with their heads cut off. No greeting, even with 4 of them.A patron asked how long the wait would be for a table for 2. A hostess quoted 45 minutes. Another patron said she made a reservation and was here early. A hostess told her she would have to wait until the earlier reservations were seated.Finally we got some attention and told them we had a reservation. They immediately took us to a table inside. The place was essentially empty. I kid you not. I cannot for the life of me understand why there would be a 45 minute wait or an inability to be seated early. Maybe staffing, but seriously? Come. On.Thankfully we didn't have any of those issues. My friend had been here before. We ordered the Pecan sticky bun, Mushroom flatbread and Pastrami smoked salmon.Mushroom flatbread was good, not great. A nice amount of salt and flavor but a bit difficult to eat. The toppings pretty much fell off the bread.Pastrami smoked salmon. Divine! Really enjoyed it. A nicely presented platter where I could put what I wanted together. Sticky bun. I think this is the reason we came. Ooey gooey goodness. Fantastic bun, not greasy. No dripping. The candied pecans were amazing.We had a great experience. Not so sure other people did.",Taj K.
539,Jersey City,2016-04-25,Uirop7LUjNG4Q0a6Q4mEnQ,5, NJ,"I was in DC for a weekend trip and Blue Duck Tavern definitely lived up to the hyped up image I had created in my mind.  The food was outstanding and the service was friendly and attentive although our waiter did occasionally disappear for long periods of time.  The bone marrow is a must order with three huge bones overflowing with fatty goodness.  The duck was possibly the best duck I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  It was tender, soft, flavorful perfection in every bite.  The sides were also great.  We had ordered the fries and were brought the polenta instead but the mistake was quickly remedied with a piping hot serving of fries.  The polenta was also amazingly rich and creamy though.  The apple pie at the end was huge!  The crust was my favorite part with a deep, caramelized flavour.  I thought the accompanying ice cream was a bit icy, however, and could have been a larger portion for a two-person dessert.  Drinks were creative and tasty, too!  Definitely check out BDT if you're in the area!",Alexandra K.

543,New York,2016-09-18,dY12-NbM0j7sfa5kv8Xj6Q,4, NY,"We kicked off my (milestone) birthday weekend here. The decor evokes a Colonial America tavern, albeit one that just had a sleek and modern makeover. We started with the sweetbreads, which I normally would not like... but they came with a peppery sauce that was spectacular. I ordered the crab cakes, which were very good... but the charred broccoli -- with honey, garlic, and chili -- was the star.Service was lovely and it was a pleasant evening. We had a great view of the open kitchen, which was fun to watch. My one negative is admittedly peculiar: there was an odd, chemical-like odor emanating from our wood table. It wasn't constant, but both of us noticed it. Maybe it was the varnish that got stirred up when the servers put down the hot serving dishes? It wouldn't keep me from going there, but it was strong enough to note.",John Y.

545,Washington,2018-03-10,ZPDLwC3nRGb0TjySJMgebg,3, DC,"I will start by saying Blue Duck Tavern is possibly my favorite restaurant in DC. And, while this wasn't the best experience I've had there, this probably won't be my last visit. The bone marrow, always delicious, the butcher's cut, even better. I wasn't crazy about the fries, but my fault for not asking the waiter to describe them ahead of time.  Now for the bad. We went with a large group, I think 16. And, BDT seated a group of six on one side of the restaurant, and the remaining group members farther away. I (and possibly some we) at the smaller table felt as though we were akin to either the ""kiddie"" table during Thanksgiving or kiddies who needed to be separated because we were on a timeout. I would not feel as much put off about the tables being so far apart if (1)  the dinner had not been scheduled for 8:45; (2) the dinner had not been scheduled so far in advance. While it isn't a huge restaurant, BDT could have done a much better job of seating even within viewing distance of each other. To me, that was quite tacky that a restaurant would seat us so far apart that we not only couldn't chat, but we couldn't even see each other. The other thing that put me off about the evening is of the six of us, only two got dessert. However, their dessert arrived after the others had paid and were departing. I'm giving three stars because the experience was just ok. The one bright spot was our waiter, he really was great.",Elizabeth W.
546,Philadelphia,2015-05-30,VuJzUbbYPtSNX2R7O9aPUg,4, PA,"A wonderful restaurant with interesting dining options, marred by some sub-par service. Considered one of the best gastropubs in Washington, DC, the menu here successfully toes the line between farm-to-table and upscale comfort food.The ambiance and decor of the Blue Duck is wonderful if you like the bustling gastropub/open kitchen concept. The whole place smells of meats and vegetables roasting in butter and the space is minimally decorated but oh-so-sleek. If you're on a date, ask for a table away from the dining room connected to the kitchen. This area should be specifically reserved for groups because of how boisterous it is -- your night could seriously be disrupted by lewd laughter and obnoxious comments parroted by drunk imitators of the Housewives of Beverly Hills. Which is, of course, what happened to us. We started with a nice bottle of Cote de Rhone -- light, round, some blackcurrent notes but nothing too severe. We tried the Foie Gras custard, which I highly recommend. Smooth, rich, creamy. I thoroughly enjoyed the complements of the peanut brittle on top. What would I change about this dish? Perhaps more liver flavor and less custard. I wanted more of that foie taste and less of the sweet. In terms of expertly crafted flavors, the smoked beet salad was the more complex and subtle of the two appetizers. The smokiness of the beets was the perfect foil to the Gorgonzola cheese -- this was probably one of the best beet salads I've ever enjoyed. Our main meal (which was shared) was the wood-fired waygu beef medium rare, along with the triple fried duckfat fries and the parmesan charred asparagus with fresh egg. Wood-fired waygu beef cooked to order but lacking in amazing flavor. I wanted more char, more smokiness, more wood-fired flavor. It was good but didn't knock my socks off. The asparagus side dish was stellar (how can you go wrong when you add an egg to a roasted vegetable?). I was disappointed by the triple-fried french fries. I am a huge lover of potatoes and found the crunch on the outside to be perfect, but the consistency of the potato inside to be on the dry side. Another good but not great dish. We were too stuffed for dessert, but also too tired. Our meal was paced very slowly, but also suffered a bit because our waiter was fairly inattentive. As I mentioned earlier, we were also placed next to an rousing group of divorcé revelers who probably made more noise than four 12 year-old girls. The night ended with a bang when one of them knocked over the wine glasses on the table and dropped the f-bomb left and right as the staff attempted to help them clean up. Overall, I'd go back to the Blue Duck Tavern. The food is excellent and the ambiance is lovely. As are most things in life, It's All About the Timing.",Hope C.

I had the salmon and my friend had a steak - both are to die for.For our appetizer, we had the mussels. It took a little while, but only because the chef didn't think the first batch was good enough, so he redid the dish. I thought that was fantastic on his part, and when the mussels arrived - they were worth the wait! So tender, juicy, and not too small/big.I think what really makes this place great is the ambience. It's not too stuffy, but the service is still amazing. Our waiter was so helpful and attentive. At the end, they brought out some ice cream and a candle for my birthday, which I personally thought was a great touch.I didn't get to try the apple pie because I thought I was going to explode from all the food I had, but I'm going to definitely try it next time!",Sunah K.

551,Queens,2015-02-17,Xnv3mfCjk5FG3uWA6I6k9g,4, NY,"It took us a good while to get here. By the time we finally booked the brunch, the chef de cuisine John Melfi have departed (yes, very old news) and Blue Duck Tavern had a few shuffles with their chefs. When you come to BDT, you also come for the experience: The setting, the service and of course, the food. The setting and the food was good, the service was great albeit a bit pushy. Our server was over suggesting and if we had really ordered the amount of food she recommended, it would have been too much. There is a difference between being indulgent and gluttonous. .To start, we had the house made pecan sticky bun. These were moist and the sweetness was just right. For main dish we ordered jumbo lump crab cake and the eggs benedict. Plus hash brown potatoes and the hand cut triple fries.The crab cake was fantastic but the portion size was too small if you opt for the half portion (2 very modest sized cakes). The eggs benedict were not mind blowing but they were good. I'm not a fan of hollandaise sauce (I was going for the smoked trout and potatoes), yet theirs was probably the best I have ever tasted and fully welcomed it. The fries were like crack, I didn't order them so I had to put some restrain on reaching over repeatedly. I was a bit confused with the hash browns though. It is not the usual, it is an interesting presentation; by the looks of it I was expecting some crunch from the outer layer yet there was none- It almost came off like a polenta stick. House made ketchup? Hmmm okay? Does this mean it is not made with corn syrup and all other additives?    One of our party was in the mood for french toast, which was not found on the menu. Our server was very kind to check in with the kitchen and they decided to make it by request. Unfortunately, the person who ordered it ended up not liking the french toast the kitchen improvised. When our server learnt this, to my surprise, they offered to replace it with another item since she wanted us to walked out of BDT satisfied. That's great hospitality. We wrapped up the brunch with the apple pie and ice cream. Little did I know that it was not a scoop of ice cream on top, but 3-4 very generous scoops. I was starting to wonder if our server was preparing us as hot dog competition eaters. If you go, you should try the apple pie. The crust, yumm... it is really good.I would come back here for dinner, I think the experience can be bit too much on a lazy weekend morning for me -- I'm too hazy to try to be elegant for this place. Nonetheless, it was a good meal... Good meal indeed.",Isabella W.

Eating here is an experience to be remembered and cherished for years to come.My husband and I come here for special occasions both large and small. Most recently, we celebrated our 1st Anniversary at the Tavern.We started our meal with a bottle of Tempernillo wine and split a Charcuterie board. This was immediately followed by a kohlrabi soup with kimchi garnish. The soup was delectably creamy and the kimchi provided a crisp contrast that made the soup even better.For dinner, we split the Wagyu beef, Risotto, Wild Mushrooms and BDT fries. The beef was superbly cooked with a lovely glaze to match the intense flavors of the beef. The risotto was creamy and extremely filling; adding the sautéed mushrooms gave it even more body and depth. The only thing that was slightly disappointing was the fries. We have had them before and it was far more superior in memory than actuality. For dessert, my husband ordered the Apple Pie and I ordered the Chocolate Guinness ice cream. I'm a dessert girl and man was this ice cream amazing! Words cannot describe. I could have eaten my weight in this heavenly treat.

Spoiler alert -- the highly touted Hand Cut Fries failed to impress. So many phenomenal options on the menu and, sadly, this falls to the bottom of the list. The fries were just dense, heavy, seemingly under-cooked and slightly bland. Such a shame because I was really looking forward to trying them.During my brunch visit with a couple out-of-town friends we ordered a series of things: Fried chicken liver over smoked gouda grits; Brioche Bread Pudding French Toast; Short Rib Hash; Brussels Sprouts with Bacon, Cranberries and Pecans; and the ""famous"" hand cut fries.

563,New York,2015-01-23,ynBLHevv5Q46ZebU3ZaJsg,5, NY,"Simply phenomenal, that's really the only way to sum up my THREE experiences (in 2 days) at Blue Duck Tavern.  I had had Blue Duck bookmarked for a long time and when upon planning a trip to DC, I knew I had to schedule a meal there.  Coincidentally, I ended up staying at the Park Hyatt, which made this reservation even more enticing.  The space is lovely, albeit, the openness is a bit difficult to navigate.  Also, this truly is an open kitchen that you walk through in order to reach your table.  At dinner, the restaurant is quite dark--mood lighting to the max.  It is definitely a date worthy destination. The food is astounding.  My meals at Blue Duck were some of my favorite of 2014.  The first dinner:I'm not usually a huge fan of sweet breads but after our server recommended them, I felt as though I had to try them.  They were exceptional.  They are lightly fried.  The pumpkin tortelli was perfectly cooked and the sauce was complementary and not overwhelming.  I do not eat pasta often, but this was definitely worth indulging in.  The vegetable special that night was a squash custard brulee with an amaretto cookie crumble.  I am so glad I got to try this dish and I wish I could eat all of my vegetables in this fashion.  It was like mashed potatoes (squash variety) with caramelized sugar on top.  SO FREAKING AWESOME.Let's not forget dessert.  Blue Duck is known for its apple pie for a reason.  The crust is perfect.  It's so great to have a pie that is completely enveloped in crust (as it is often the best part).  The filling was good too but the crust is where it's at.Our server, David, was exceptional.  He was extremely attentive, warm, and helpful.  After an amazing dinner, we decided to not only return for breakfast the next morning, but I decided to cancel our reservation at a different restaurant the following night as well and return to Blue Duck for dinner.Breakfast: PUMPKIN LATTE PANCAKES.   They actually are as good as they sound.  The pumpkin pancakes themselves had a pungent pumpkin flavor and were nice and fluffy; I'd say the consistency was probably the best I've had in recent memory.  The latte cream on top is delicious.  Oh yes, let's not forget the mocha cookie crumble! So delicious.  Also, the maple syrup on the side was perfection.  The sticky buns were a bit disappointing compared to the pancakes, but I really didn't care.  Dinner 2: Tuna carpaccio is delicious and light.  The brussels sprouts were perfectly cooked and the mustard BBQ was great.  Some of the best brussels sprouts I've ever had.  Braised beef rib was also a great choice.  Only slight disappoint was the duck fat fries.  I feel like the hype was a little too strong, save your calories for dessert.Dessert: Red wine plum crumble!!!!  Amazing.  I don't even know if the apple pie was better than this, it was sooooo great.  I even ate all of the plums.Ultimately, Blue Duck Tavern not only serves amazing food but the experience is a memorable one.  This place is destination worthy and one of my new favorite restaurants.  It seems as though they perform well on all fronts.",Julie M.

The chef is tremendous and if you can ever get the chef's tasting menu (whatever he feels like making that day) get it!,Rich S.
569,Washington,2016-02-01,2uPKmvcLduV6j-EF9u0Mqg,2, DC,"It pains me to give a mediocre review to one of our favorite restaurants in DC but I do want the management to be aware of the impression they left our party of 10.We had scheduled a birthday party and reserved a semi-private table in the back of the house for 9pm on a Saturday night.  Leading up to the occasion, we reiterated to the front of the house how important this setting was to us and that we wanted to see the space and table beforehand to ensure it would work for our group (balancing privacy and fun with members of our party with hearing challenges).  In-person and twice on the phone we requested an advance copy of the wine list because two members of our party are sommeliers and wanted to offer and pay for a bottle of wine in advance (without making a big deal of it at the end of the evening).  Despite the promises, the restaurant never sent the wine list.After confirming with credit card and by phone, when our party arrived at the restaurant we were taken immediately to a different table in the bar area of the restaurant - causing our guest of honor a lot of angst because he did NOT ok this location.  We had to escalate to restaurant management and then wait for almost 40 minutes to have the table we had reserved.  While we appreciate the bubbly and antipasti that were offered, it broke the cadence of our evening and caused a lot of consternation with our guests who were not happy with where they were originally seated.  The food was, ultimately, wonderful and we had very good wait staff.  If you have larger groups, we warned that communication to/from this restaurant in advance of a special occasion was difficult, and execution of that which was promised was lacking.We'll still come back here for smaller dinners, but will likely think twice about hosting a large gather here because we do not want to take the risk of a repeat performance.",David S.
570,Boston,2013-07-14,4LtoGBbx9h7aokhhxyEhBA,5, MA,"After reading reviews about this place online and hearing rave reviews from local who have ate here I decided to book their Sunday brunch while in DC for the weekend. The Blue Duck is located inside a Hilton Hotel and the restaurant maintains the same level of high service. I would describe this place as a semi-formal place, I wouldn't go in your gym cloths. This is a must visit restaurant to visit in DC. Brunch is pretty reasonable given the quality of the meal.Watermelon Juice - Unlimited refills of this delicious nectar. Tastes exactly like drinking a watermelonShort Rib Hash - The dish came topped with an olive oil poached egg and a large biscuit on the side. The short rib was perfectly tender and the marinate that was used was excellent. This is a must try dish.Eggs Florentine - Salmon and spinach on a biscuit smothered in hollandaise sauce. The whole dish was blended together perfectly. Apple Pie - You've seen the pictures, you've read the reviews. If you are too full to eat it after your meal they package them up nicely to go.",Michael C.

574,London,2015-03-20,DJKM63UaU9tM3mCKOH3LMQ,4, United Kingdom,"Blue Duck has a very nice ambiance with a lovely open kitchen layout. The restaurant is located inside of the Hyatt but doesn't feel like a hotel restaurant because it has its own entrance, which is a big plus. The ""tavern"" part of the name is quite misleading- there is nothing ""taverny"" about the decor or the customers' attire! As an appetizer I highly recommend the Charred Kale Caesar salad. It is perfectly dressed and comes with grapes and a poached egg- the flavors were fantastic and it was literally one of the best salads I've ever eaten. My colleagues and I agreed that it was the greatest dish of the meal, which is really saying something because everything was quite good. I followed the overwhelming Yelp consensus and ordered the 12-Hour Roasted Suckling Pig. The pig was amazing- tender and incredibly flavorful. For sides we had the Hand-Cut BDT Triple Fries, Brussels Sprouts with Pickled Cranberries and Mustard BBQ, and the Creamy Stone-Ground Grits. The brussels sprouts were perfectly crispy and very delicious, but the other two were misses. I was rather disappointed by the fries, as I found them to be way too thick and lacking a depth of flavor. I am a HUGE fan of cheesy grits and these didn't do it for me at all- they were very creamy but barely tasted of gouda. For dessert we had to order the Apple Pie for Two and it did not disappoint. Three of us could not finish it after such a delicious and heavy meal, so I would say it's more like Apple Pie for Four Reasonable Eaters. Regardless, it was great and as other reviewers have mentioned, the brûléed crust is what really makes this dish.",Caitrin O.
575,Manhattan,2016-09-08,_upz8ydQ1Fn0YDV6NnNwVA,5, NY,"Had a very good dining experience here with some co-workers. We came in early on a weeknight and even though we had no reservation, we managed to get a table (there were four of us). We had to wait a bit, but they sat us down in this sort of long hallway with tables that they have and took our cocktail orders. The drinks were expensive but very good.We all ordered different things, plus some appetizers; I remember one of my co-workers raving about the pork shoulder and another praising a steak. I personally had the fish (I forget which it was; it was a white fish is what I remember) and it was pretty great. I had to leave early to get to a Wizards game and the head waiter rang me right up and was very gracious about it. Lovely experience and ambience.",Jerry V.
576,Hoboken,2016-04-24,6a8VPU-nz1LeZbjletE9Kg,3, NJ,"Some good things to still say about the B.D. but can't jump up and down about it like I used to. You feel the switch over when a restaurant is too comfortable with all of the hype and stops trying hard, or worse, becomes pretentious. The cocktails are really consistent and that hasn't changed. The wine list, espec. by the glass, is commendable. My server was pushing Cal. wines and kind of putting down some really excellent French wines. This was puzzling and felt like he was messing with me. Chose a rose' from Provence and it did not fail to impress, especially with the amazing pasta carbonara with duck. The rack of lamb and the duck were cooked to perfection and very tender. Both needed more inspiring sauces, as the sour cream sauce on the lamb was kind of uneventful and the duck looked like Marnie in ""Girls"" wearing an expensive evening gown with no shoes on. The rock fish was a huge mistake for the simple reason that it looked like a Lean Cuisine portion and turned us off. The polenta with cheese was a solid 10, as were the braised greens. No one came around to ask if I wanted a second glass of wine.The servers seemed reasonably friendly but very distracted and disconnected. They were attentive at the beginning of dinner but fell off the welcome wagon somewhere between the garlic soup and the carbonara. Was not feeling the love at this point. Always get the apple pie here... You have to ask for either whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, (pretty mediocre and strange tasting), because they do not suggest any accompaniment to the pie. I kind of want to come back here because maybe they were just having an off night.Gotta mull that over. In the meantime, plenty of other great places to try in DC for more than just a hotel restaurant experience, while trying to pawn off a real stinker of a table in the most crowded part of the center room.",Lucienne D.

I had the BDT Benedict. It was everything a Benedict should be, especially the hollandaise sauce. So many places don't get it right. They nailed it. Thrown in a couple breaded fried oysters, and it was a hit. I'll definitely be back to check out lunch and dinner selections.",David L.

Locally sourced, seasonal and perfectly paired. Lastly, and probably the most important, the service was out of this world. The staff was kind and attentive but never in the way. They were in and out without you knowing and we never wanted for anything. They were so enthusiastic; it was a truly pleasurable experience! We had the lamb, pork chops, quail, duck breast and whole duck. Get the whole duck!!! Holy smokes, so delicious. The Chef came out to describe the dish which I truly appreciated; he was very passionate and you could tell he loves creating beautiful flavors and foods. Highly recommend this place!",Thea D.

I have probably visited BDT over 20 times Sadly, I think the michelin star has gotten to their head. The last two times I have been there have been since they were awarded the star and the service has been awful. The first time, we waited almost 40 minutes for our entrees and the second time which by the way was on new years eve with the very pricey four course menu, the manager asked us to move to from our table mid meal to the lounge so he could sit another group!

The food was delicious, but it was the service and the layout of the bar area that ruined my experience.It was during peak hours. Without reservations, we tried hard to find two close seats at the walk-in bar area. Nothing wrong about this fact itself, but during the seat-finding process the servers at the front desk and those at the bar area were so impatient that I felt they just did not care whether we stay or leave. I would have left at that time were this restaurant not on my friend's wish list.Finally we found two seats, but at a very inconvenient corner. Every time when I wanted to go to or left my seat, I had to step onto the edge of a window. I just cannot believe how people come out with an indoor layout design like that.To make things worse, I had to leave my seat several times to approach the servers, because they ignored us for ten minutes after we got seated. I knew they were busy, but how many precious seconds could it take them to grab water and menus for us?Things got back on track when they started to pay attention to us, take our order and get the meal started. There was nothing to blame after that, but my awful experience during my first 20 minutes here would keep me away from this place for a while.",Jinfeng X.
582,Milan,2016-01-19,DyNuVgZV7Jtbvg2_8xGyLQ,5, Italy,"Excellent dinning experience!!Came to the Blue Duck Tavern with a group of professionals for breakfast. I ordered house made smoked salmon which comes with hash-browns, creme fraiche, trout roe, and quail egg. The salmon is not very big, but the whole meal in my idea is quite a fair size. I had a side of fresh fruits on salad which I loved the most, it was super colorful and made a great ending to my healthy breakfast! Our waiter (whom I cannot remember the name) was super attentive. He brought me a new set of fork and knife just because he saw that I am done with my meal and want to start the fruits-- this doesn't happen that often, unless you ask the waiter to bring you a new set. Anyway, I was quite impressed by both the quality of food and the service. This place definitely worth a try if you are looking for something SPECIAL.",Niloofar A.

Weather permitting, request to sit outside on the patio! They have these two ducks who live on the fountain. It's pretty cute and they apparently settled there by coincidence (my friend joked that they probably sedate the cute ducks to make sure they do not move... not sure if there's any truth to it).I got the pepper cucumber cocktail and it was the perfect refreshing starter cocktail. Pretty strong too, may I add. My boyfriend got the old fashioned. If you want to get drunk, get that because they make that really strong as well. Our waiter raved about our bartender... I can see why.Most importantly: the food! Just like every other reviewer, I strongly advise that you order the Wood Oven-Roasted Bone Marrow. Please do it! I know - bone marrow like what the hell? Sounds daunting but you will not regret it. You carve out the meat/cream/butter/garlic/WHATEVER the heavenly mix is in that bone marrow and put it on top of garlic toast. Look at the picture and just love yourself for listening to me (and everyone who posted a review here) or hate yourself for not ordering it. Entrees: Roasted Muscovy Roasted Duck Breast - GOLD. They serve it with a strawberry ruhbarb marmalade *cries while starting to think about how good it was*Seared Diver Scallops w/ Glazed Pork Belly - Great, especially with the pork belly! Sides: Hand-Cut BDT Triple Fries - Typical french fries but definitely thicker and less crispy. Very filling and good but I would pick something else to be honest.Charred Asparagus - Topped with Parmesan and a poached egg. This was especially delicious! Our waiter recommended it and I was pleased.Dessert: Strawberry Rhubarb Pop Tart. Think about all the hype that Ted's Bulletin's pop tarts gets and then multiply by 20.

OMG, the bone marrow is the best around by far. The richness of the marrow with the garlic cloves just melts in your mouth as the toasted bread gave a nice crunch to round out the the bite.  My husband had the charcuterie platter and short ribs both were delish as well.

Service was friendly and smiling and knew the menu backwards and forwards. It's a large, busy restaurant with lots of wood, but it doesn't feel overly noisy. There are some open kitchen and prep areas, including, it looked to me, like a table merely for slicing bread. There was also a table where they were prepping the signature apple pie desserts. These are advertised as being for two. From what I saw, they would be big enough for 12 people to share. We tried several things on the menu and they were all delicious--the bison flank steak with braised cabbage, the side salad, sautéed mushrooms, the gouda polenta, and especially the Brussels sprouts with a mustard-BBQ glaze. I'm not even a big Brussels sprout fan, but these were so meaty and flavorful and delicious, I told my friend as we were leaving that even as full as I was, I wanted to snatch the tureen of sprouts off our neighbor's table and make off with them.Since we were full, we tried to go small on dessert and just chose from their selection of ice creams and sorbets. Be aware that one scoop is a gracious plenty--it's a generous amount.I would definitely return here, as there were lots of things on the menu that looked appealing and I have full confidence in the kitchen's abilities!",Adam B.

Also had a delicious cocktail that had passionfruit in it. The standout was definitely the braised beef -- it was so tender it almost fell apart and it melted it your mouth. Service was very nice and we enjoyed the view of the kitchen from our table. With such a nice restaurant the table was a bit bare and could have used a candle or something.

599,McLean,2016-01-02,ShIYbCH8vWG2Sf51v7Hl9w,5, VA,"I had the pleasure of visiting the Blue Duck Tavern after Christmas. It was raining (seriously, when has it not been raining lately?) and the lovely valet of the Park Hyatt walked to my side of the car, opened my door, and escorted me to the door while holding an umbrella over my head. Classy.To be honest, with a name as unremarkable as Blue Duck and the fact that it's inside a hotel, I really didn't think this place would be as nice as it was. But I underestimated them and that was very clear within a few minutes of sitting down and talking to our waiter. I don't even want to call him a waiter, because he was more like a food liason. The space is beautiful and the open kitchen was unexpected. Our server was incredibly helpful throughout the experience, and he explained everything in detail and answered all of our questions thoroughly. And he genuinely seemed to love the place, so when he was naming the specials and going through the menu, it didn't seem like it was a chore.We ended up with oysters (if you like oysters, get them) and the soup. The soup was a cream of celery with small croutons and crab meat. The presentation was top notch: small croutons were scattered in the bottom of the bowl, with a mound of crab meat in the middle, and a server came by, placed the bowl, and then poured the soup in a circular motion to fill the bowl. And it was delicious, too.We got the fish special, scallops, and crab cakes. Also got the brussels sprouts and the polenta to share. All the entrees were delicious, cooked perfectly and complimented by everything on the plate. I had the crab cakes and they were packed full of meat, none of that mostly filler business. The brussels sprouts were delicious and the sauce was great. And the polenta was creamy, cheesy, and had a great consistency. The night was finished with all three of us sharing a slice of the apple pie- which was huge. On the menu it said it was meant to be shared between two people, but it was easily split between three. We got some vanilla ice cream to go with it. It was a perfect way to end the meal. The apples were thick and fresh, and I am not a crust person, but the crust was flaky and delicious. The ice cream was the perfect compliment. Overall, we had a fantastic meal. There really wasn't anything that they could have done better. Great place for a special date or occasion, but probably wouldn't come here for a casual dinner. If you're looking for a delicious meal and the whole experience for someone special, check out Blue Duck.",Judith L.
600,San Francisco,2015-02-14,LpaHmpMq8sA6YTT8cpG7zg,4, CA,"Stayed at the Park Hyatt for a work trip and decided to head down to Blue Duck to sit at the bar and have dinner. I had the caesar kale salad, and a lobster roll, and some sort of dessert I'm now forgetting and two cocktails... Yeah I know it's a lot of food but I was sitting for a long time and to be fair the portion size was not that large!  All in all the food was very good as were their cocktails. As one would expect it was quite pricey, I think the lobster roll was one of the most reasonable things on the menu at something like $12. However my other choices quickly made up for that.  I think I closed out the meal at around 100 sans tip. Which to be fair is not that outrageous by any means given the caliber of the hotel. Highlights for me were the oysters and the salad by far. I would definitely return for either of those. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone staying in the Park Hyatt or otherwise.

I had pretty high expectations going into dinner and honestly, most of them were met. We came into the restaurant through the Hyatt hotel so we got to walk through the open kitchen concept which was very cool. Immediately, the service made it feel very high class. Our waiter had a thick accent but he was nice and attentive. He went over the menu and we made our orders. We started with the bone marrow appetizer and for our main courses, I ordered scallops and my boyfriend ordered 2 crab cakes. We also get a side of Brussels sprouts. Overall, everything was very good and what you would expect of a fancy restaurant but it was all also very salty. The bone marrow was delicious but overly seasoned. The Brussels sprouts were salty as were the scallops.

They're not overbearing, yet they make sure that you have everything you need and any questions regarding food and drinks are promptly answered.Food here is also very good. For brunch, the belgian waffles were light and airy in the middle yet had a nice little crisp on the outside, which is the way I like my waffles. Portioning is appropriate for brunch. Got a couple chicken sausage links on the side, which were also very good.We also tried the apple pie which everyone has been raving about, and to be honest, I thought it was just ok. Aesthetically, it's very pleasing with a nice cylindrical structure, and the top, which was a very thin, flaky crust with caramelized sugar. The top disc really was the best part of the apple pie. The side crush wasn't as flaky as I thought it could be and the center filled just kind of fell a little flat. Also, it wasn't as nice and warm to be eaten well with the vanilla ice cream that was provided.",Varun B.

605,Palo Alto,2015-12-26,5saLlSI-QIX4z9an7iMarA,4, CA,"They're located inside the Hyatt, but it's much better than you would expect for a hotel restaurant. We came for Sunday brunch. On the house, they served us the BDT hand cut fries. They were described as ""hash brown style"" - it was basically like fried cubes of mashed potatoes, and the inside was super smooth. It came with a Red pepper aioli.Dishes:1. Fried cauliflower: 3 large pieces, tender, lightly battered, but the highlight was the mustard seed vinaigrette on top 2. Shrimp and grits: plump shrimp, greens, and a grit cake with a seafood gravy. This was actually much lighter than your usual shrimp and grits, so I liked it3. Short rib hash: the short rib was cut into cubes after being cooked down in steak sauce and root beer. It was pretty fatty and rich, but the flavor was good. It's topped with a horseradish cream and an olive oil poached runny egg.  It came with a biscuit on the side, which was pretty filling4. Biscuits and gravy: I loved the texture of the edges and tops of the biscuits. The sausage gravy was good, especially after adding extra black pepper 5. Chicken biscuit: a fried chicken thigh and greens on a biscuit.  The apple butter added sweetness and balanced the dishService was super polite. Even though it's a more formal place, it ended up being ok with young kids, and they were really nice about offering to make some menu modifications for the kids.",Marilyn T.

Unfortunately, it was gone when we showed up, and the only veggie options were side dishes.

Our server, Robert, gave us a thorough description of the menu, focusing on their most popular/famous dishes. His enthusiasm for the menu made us even more excited for our meal. We also appreciated the quality of service. Robert was attentive without being overbearing, which really helped us to enjoy our experience. The bread they brought out to begin the meal was fresh and delicious. For appetizers, we started with the Brussels sprouts and BDT fries, both of which were excellent. For entrees, my fiancé had the braised short ribs and I had the crab cake for our main course. I can safely say that it was one of the best crab cakes I have ever had. We finished with the apple pie. It was incredible, definitely large enough for 2-3 people to share. Really, everything we had was excellent.

We ordered the blueberry pancakes, short rib hash, smoked salmon starter, assorted danishes, bone marrow and fries.Service: pretty good and attentive, on that note I'd give them 5 stars, specially since they were able to accommodate us 45 minutes before our reservation. However it took them a while to bring our food out but they compensated by giving us grits and dessert. Which is appreciated .Food: I really enjoyed the smoked salmon. Three of us ordered the blueberry pancakes and were a bit disappointed by them. Not a whole lot of flavor and fluffiness, and I've never met a person who prefers flat pancakes to light and fluffy. The bone marrow was very greasy and probably my least favorite dish. The short rib hash was very very salty. All in all it wasn't the best brunch I've had in DC. But I've been to blue duck for lunch and dinner and know they're a great restaurant and can dish out terrific food.

Before I begin, I should say that our service was outstanding as well. Our server Dave was a gentlemen and a true scholar with the menu. He seemed like a chef when he described the unbelievable menu options. We started with the bone marrow and baby gem salad. The marrow was cooked elegantly, and the complexity of the tastes and spices used in the preparation added to the richness of the meal. We next had the soft shell crab which was cooked as if someone's life depended on it being perfect. The crabs were gigantic and each buttery crunchy bite seemed better than the last. In the end, the meal just made me sad, because I wanted more. My sadness did not last long. These assholes had the audacity to hand me a literal bowl of heaven for dessert. As I was fighting back tears, I faintly heard Dave, our server, tell me in the background that I was eating a butterscotch pudding topped with malt ice cream, a tiny crunchy funnel cake that was so good I felt like declaring it the meaning of life itself, and a generous helping of marshmallows and miniature chocolate malt balls that seemed like old friends when eaten together. I really think they hand you bowls of these when you are walking into heaven as a welcome aperitif. Eat here.",Charles I.

We wish we ordered two of those instead of everything else we got. The pumpkin tortelli was not my favorite. The pumpkin taste was too overpowering, so none of the other tastes came through.

I have never been somewhere where they fold your napkin whenever you get up from your table.That night is etched in my memory, for reasons that surpass Blue Duck Tavern, but the service here astounded me and I thought of this restaurant as the one I compare all other experiences to.So when I had to spend a day in Washington DC, I knew I would treat myself to a dinner here. I made a reservation for 1, and I'm happy I did. It was exactly as I expected.My server was Yves, and I was happy each time he came over to check in on me. I felt very alone, this was my first time dining out by myself in a place like this, and somehow he made me feel a bit more welcomed and safe. (Thank you Yves).I had two orders of tea, a Moscow mule, oysters, a whole fish, a side of wild mushrooms, and panna cotta for dessert. By the time dessert arrived, I wasn't very hungry. Yves took it off the check since I didn't seem to enjoy it, and while he didn't have to, I appreciated the gesture. The mushrooms were my favorite during the meal, so delicious. I regretted ordering the whole fish, I should have gone with the scallops - is there any delicate way to pick out the bones? Nonetheless my entire meal was delicious. As a server myself, Yves and BDT enlightened me. I love good service, and I like reciprocating it.

I had the short rib hash, hubby had the BDT brunch burger, and we shared a plate of fried tomatoes.

For example their eggs Benedict are not served with your typical smoked salmon, but with a trout and lemon flavored hollandaise. Everything was perfectly executed.

There were a few things going in to it that caused me a little concern. It's not cheap, but the food, drinks, and service are all absolutely worth it. Our server was David, and he made our dinner very personable and enjoyable. Every now and then he would come over to check in on us, and told us about the restaurant (we were even offered a tour, which was very nice). Since we will probably be back, he convinced us to order the duck next time (and to save room for the apple pie). We didn't order any appetizers, but he thought we might enjoy their Fire Roasted Acorn Squash Salad, so he brought some out for us as a treat. It was delicious. My boyfriend got the Prime Steak, which was absolutely incredible. It's served in a very yummy red wine sauce. I got the Roasted Chicken, which was unlike and chicken I've ever had. I was worried that it would be a boring thing to order, but I'm going to be dreaming about it for awhile. I didn't know chicken could taste like that. As a side, we ordered the fries, which we were barely able to finish. If you get them, be sure to use the garlic aioli they're served with. Since it was his birthday, they brought out the caramel pretzel (also a treat on them). AMAZING. A very creative dessert. David also brought us some of the dessert wine, the La Fleur d'Or, which was a really nice end to an incredible meal. I can't recommend this place enough. I've been living in DC for a little over five months, and this is far and away the best meal I've had here.",Kayla S.

It was warm, homey and everyone was very pleasant.But without further ado, the food! Top to bottom, BDT had tremendous food. I've never had a meal so completely delicious from the fresh warm bread to the succulent dripping bone barrow to the fresh pear salad to my perfectly cooked duck with berry glaze. Even the fluffy cornbread, the crisp Brussel sprouts, and the sweet potato mash showed the immense attention to detail on every part of the meal. Every time we took a bite we tittered excitedly, ""try this one, try this one!"" or ""Oh my god, sooooo good."" By the end of the evening we were so giddy that we couldn't contain ourselves.

It is in a good location--but we had to circle around a couple times for street parking. The decor and interior was very nice, though--and you can walk through the kitchen and see the chefs in action, and the food was pretty good and well-presented, but the service was just not up to standards.We walked in, and the hostess asked us how many we were...and then walked away?? Another hostess asked if we had reservations, I said no, and she typed my name in before finally taking us to our seat. We sat around for awhile waiting...and then the server finally came and asked us what drinks we wanted to order...we just asked for water, but were going to order---but she walked away before we could tell us that we were ready. Our food came out before our drinks...like I was literally 3/4 done with my food before my tea and mimosa came. Then she forgot to give me a cup for my tea. My Genmaicha was steeped for too long and burnt. She forgot about our watermelon juice...we asked about it after we were done with all our food and other drinks and said she HAD put in the order but that she'd bring one out on the house--that was okay, I guess...except for the fact that we were ready to go.The food:**Crab Frittata: pretty amazing--the asparagus and potatoes were cooked into the egg, which looked really awesome. It lacked flavor in my opinion, but was definitely fresh and well prepared.**Watermelon juice: very fresh and delicious**Pineapple mint mimosa: I've never seen such a variety of mimosas and bloody mary's, so I give them props on that. And both the ones we tried were delicious.I guess aside from the service (I guess I had higher expectations for a place that has average $20 entrees for brunch), the decor and food were pretty good.

You can either go light or go heavy. The drinks and coffee aren't too much to write home about, but the food was delicious. The wood-oven roasted bone marrow became an instant favorite of mine. If you're into bone marrow, this was one of the more marrow-y (if that even makes sense) bone marrow dishes I've had. The egg white omelette was fresh and healthy, but small and a little overpriced. The short rib hash was excellent. The horseradish sauce was a great complement to the meat and eggs. Paid valet is available, but street parking shouldn't be a problem.",Tunaidi A.

I enjoyed the 12-hour roasted suckling pig, which was fork tender, similar in texture to pulled pork (of course), and had a sweet, crackling, caramelized topping. Roasted yellow carrots, baby French radishes, and other vegetables accompanied the meal. I also sampled a side of roasted seasonal vegetables which included zucchini, summer squash, and onions. Alas, we were running late so there was no time for appetizers or dessert.The only negative was the waiter who I felt tried hard to upsell us on additions to the meal.",Ann W.

645,Boston,2014-08-26,7UMA8ogC_2mYp2pBSsZdHQ,5, MA,"When looking for places to eat while visiting DC, Blue Duck Tavern consistently came up as one of the best restaurants in the city. My hosts made a reservation for Sunday night and I couldn't wait!Located inside the Park Hyatt Hotel, Blue Duck Tavern is definitely on the fancy side. After a hot day of sightseeing in the city, we were a little under-dressed for the occasion, so I was excited to see they had an outdoor patio that looked a bit more casual. Unfortunately when we got there all of the outdoor tables were taken, so we set up shop at a table right next to the kitchen. I loved the open view of the kitchen -- it's so fun to watch the chefs in action.After about 5 minutes the hostess told us they had a cancellation and a table outside was ready for us if we wanted it. It was a beautiful night, so even though I was a sad to leave the kitchen view, we decided to head outside.Our waiter came over immediately and discussed the menu with us. From start to finish he was attentive, friendly and answered all of our questions with a big smile. We started by ordering some summery cocktails and an AMAZING scallop carpaccio appetizer. This carpaccio may have been the best thing I ate all weekend in DC!The menu is broken into meat, pork, fish and vegetarian entrees, then sides to share with the table. Every single thing on the menu sounded amazing, and I had a really hard time deciding what to order! I made a last second decision and went with the 12-hour braised beef rib with house made sauce. It was a REALLY good choice -- I loved it!!I also got to try some of friends' 12-hour roasted suckling pig and bison hangar steak. Both entrees were really delicious and would be worth ordering. For sides, we shared the creamy stone-ground grits (with smoked gouda and red-eye gravy) and the fried green tomatoes (topped with crab meat). I really enjoyed both side dishes, especially the grits.We were intrigued by dessert, but were way too full to order anything else. It was a really amazing dinner and a great way to spend my last night in DC!",Julie B.
646,Washington,2012-10-25,1UlJknvoh8IXrV1DlLvE3Q,5, DC,"Brunch is magnifique! From the homemade muffin, croissant to the short rib hash dish I had, it was an incredible experience.  The apple pie was delish but overall the berry crumb was so good that I kept myself from licking the dish!  I can't express how much the brioche bread pudding french toast had all the right mixture of sweet flavors and hands down was the best I ever had -- it will be my next dessert!   Hold up, did I forget to mention the moist succulent chicken and waffles --  oy vey!   It will be tough making my selection on my next brunch outing, so what the hay, let's order one of each please:)  I can't tell you how much I loved their brunch, their service and ambiance.  If Yelp let me, I would give it 10 stars hands down and so would my friends.  Will I go back, yes of course! I'd like to try their dinner as I've heard equally rave reviews.  I can't wait!  Stay tuned for my next review.",Flo S.

We started our meal with the sorbet mimosas which are absolutely delish! You can choose which featured sorbet you would like to have, and there's a sweet surprise inside your mimosa when it arrives, a rock candy stirring stick. For our appetizers we had the oysters and the bone marrow. The oysters were flown in from Canada, and they were paired with perfectly fresh horseradish. The bone marrow was very flavorful, and was served with warm crisp bread. For the main course I had the white chocolate bread pudding french toast, which may have been the best french toast I have ever had. It was wonderfully decadent, and paired with pears and jam. I finished my meal with a delightful rooibos tea, which had a crisp floral finish. I will recommend this place to all. From the ambience of the outdoor patio to the excellence of the food, it is a great selection for a palate pleasing brunch!m",Ceonna P.

Our server, Michael was polite, sincere, welcoming, and attentive (but not intrusive). We didn't seem to notice any type of hold up with the food, but he brought out extra pastries for us to munch on. When our entrees were brought out he brought out a complimentary carrot cake waffles for the four of us to share. We are looking forward to returning for dinner sometime soon :)",Colleen P.

651,Springfield,2017-06-14,vr9QtjjzUUHqS-fbMrFTTA,2, VA,"Really wanted to like BDT more but the service was quite slow and inconsistent, the food was hit or miss, and it's all generally overpriced.  We went for Sunday brunch and while the place was only half full and we had 3-4 different people serving our table, everything moved at a snail's pace.  It was a good 20-30 minutes from when we ordered until our entrees arrived.  While most of my entree was great (short rib hash) there were mixed reviews from my friends on the soft shell crab and waffle dish and pastry plate and the biscuit that came with my dish was bone dry.  While the wait staff was very friendly and tried to be helpful we had a few service issues. My dish came with a poached egg so I asked to have scrambled instead which they said was no problem and asked if I wanted them very cooked or not and I said medium. However I ended up with a sunny side egg instead.  They immediately went to get the scrambled eggs and I got a small plate with a sheet of tasteless eggs.  My friend ordered bacon which never arrived and we had to ask them to take it off the check.  I also ordered plain club soda but was served a $5 mini bottle of mineral water instead.  The amount of jam they brought with the pastry dish could fit in a thimble and we had to ask for more.  I also had to ask for butter for my biscuit (I would have assumed it would come automatically).  And lastly when we asked for the check the brought the dessert menu instead and we had to ask again.  I think it took us a good 20 minutes from asking for the check to actually being able to get up and leave. Unfortunately just a mediocre experience all around, especially for the price.",Jess F.

654,McLean,2016-02-09,EEzmJF3nRibjy4W4NRmIrw,5, VA,"We went here for my boyfriend's birthday and couldn't be happier with our choice! One word: SERVICE. These servers go out of their way to make sure you are happy with your food and drink choices. The ambiance is beautiful - everything from the extremely tall doors when you first walk in to the solid wood tables.We had the soup of the day, Lobster Bisque, which had a sparky but very smooth consistency. For main course was the Short Rib and Duck. Both were perfectly cooked. Short Rib was falling apart with tenderness and the sauce it was paired was delicious. The duck came with a cranberry sauce of some sort - it's like that combo was meant to be. We also got a side of the garlic potatoes which, as expected, did not disappoint.Yes, it is on the pricier side but you are paying for what you get. The food is all locally sourced and when it's not in season nearby (such as crab or certain vegetables), they go to the next closest farm to get it. This place pays attention to detail, which is huge for me.We were stuffed so didn't get dessert. The table next to us got the apple pie for 2 and that was enough to tell our server we'll be back for it!",Katie K.

We were not disappointed -- the food is creative and delicious, with a wide variety of options for omnivores, pescatarians, and vegetarians. The ambiance is very nice, though the restaurant is louder than I expected (maybe because of the high ceilings), and the background music is really bad (some kind of pop/jazz music with loud pumping percussion that's all you can hear over the background noise). Service was mostly very good, though I had to wait much longer than I expected to order a bottle of wine, and had to pour my own wine several times. We would definitely go back, especially for a nice pre-theater meal if we were going to the Kennedy Center.",Marie D.
657,New York,2015-08-31,kwO3yRdBpQT577VPpG3TFw,3, NY,"I've stayed at the adjoining Park Hyatt Hotel twice this year, and as a result, have eaten lots of meals in the Blue Duck Tavern- breakfast, brunch, dinner, and in-room dining.  Honestly, my experiences here have ranged from not-so-good to wonderful.The dinners I've had here (2) were generally great.  Note- I recommend to NOT take a table along the wooden bench.  I'm relatively young and healthy, but that bench was soooo uncomfortable, my back was aching horribly after just a few short minutes.  I did not ask to be reseated, as I had a toddler with me, and it was crowded and I didn't want to make a fuss.  But, that bench needs to go.  I GET that they're trying to coordinate the decor with the Japanese minimalist style of the Park Hyatt, but I don't think that style translates well.  The result is austere and bleak.  Sitting on those wooden benches, I felt I was about to witness a witch trial.  Anyway, back to the dinner service- it was impeccable and world-class.  I will say the cocktail list is a bit pretentious.  I hadn't heard of most of the spirits used in the cocktails, and I'm a full-time drinker who makes several trips into my neighborhood liquor & wine shops every week.  I've never had such perfectly cooked chicken breast, they really have that down to a science.  The foie gras appetizer was just perfect!!!!  Cheeseburger is delicious.  Chocolate pudding dessert is totally worth ordering.  I didn't really care for the fries, which are very, very thick and fried in duck fat (this may be a matter of personal preference, but I like skinny, truffle fries).  Really, all the food was great.  Breakfast was very disappointing.  We had breakfast included every day in our hotel rate (Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts).  I took my baby in there the first day, and some of the guests (uptight DC/government types) seemed rather intolerant of children, so for the rest of the week we ordered from room service.  The breakfast food was not so good- omlettes were too dense, not fluffy, and overall lack of flavor in the food.  Would not recommend this restaurant for breakfast.  I've had 2 brunches here, and the service was horrible.  I mean, HORRIBLE.  I guess they were working with a skeleton staff?  There were dirty dishes all over our table, and nobody cleared them for like 20 minutes, until we asked them to.  Took forever for anyone to ever come to our table.  I had a guest for 1 brunch, and it was very embarrassing.  Would NOT recommend for brunch.Side note- had carrot cake sent up to my room one evening, and it was AMAZING!  Like, I should have gone and asked, begged the chef for the recipe.  It was dense, but not too sweet.  The icing was creamy, but not too rich.  Perfectly spicy.  Yummm!!Okay so to recap-  Come here for dinner, but not breakfast or brunch.  Ask the servers for assistance with the cocktail list, they'll be helpful without being condescending (obvi, they didn't know what those liquors were, either, before working at BDT).  And for christ sake DO NOT SIT on those long benches!",Megan F.

664,Los Angeles,2016-11-05,7TVBeY1jv-zVFRiK-vQt_w,5, CA,"This is my go to place when I have friends visiting town and they want somewhere nice to eat. I'll run down a few things on the menu.Bone marrow. Must get. Comes with toasted bread and roasted garlic to spread with your marrow. Only negative I have to say is sometimes it's a coin toss how much marrow you're going to get in your pieces of bone. I wished they tried to be a little more consistent because there have been times I've only received very shallow pieces and have been a little disappointed.Oysters. Only had them once here but they were nice fat oyster, just clean taste. Tobasco does not come with the oysters but they provide it if you ask.Braised beef rib. Fantastic, highly recommend. However, it did not seem to be on the menu last time I was there. The meat is tender and flavorful and everyone that I've had try it has loved it. I hope they bring this menu item back.BDT fries. Love these extra thick cut fries. They come with a creamy sauce and I highly recommend!Crab cakes. Among my favorite crab cakes in the city. A bit on the pricey end but the crab cake patties are a good healthy size so I don't feel jipped. Depending on how hungry I am and how many sides we plan to order I'll alternate between getting one or two.Apple pie. These mini Apple pies are fantastic but I usually don't have room after dinner for dessert. I love to take the Apple pie and ice cream to go and have it later (their ice cream is fantastic so you must get it with the pie!). Just pop the Apple pie in the oven to warm it up and it's as good as in the restaurant!",Elaine D.
665,New York,2015-07-14,dwPWhzAjXVkldU25_I6pqQ,5, NY,"Of all restaurants in DC, this is the restaurant I would recommended. Super easy to get a reservation, and the restaurant itself is super ~~fAnCy~~!! Would definitely come with a hot date who will pay your bills. Because its expensive, and I want to order the whole menu. Here's a review by food -  - Fois Grais: After reading the controversy around this I would never order this again, but in fairness, this dish was super delicious- Farm Fresh Vegetables - oddly my favorite dish of the night. Super fresh and delicious vegetables over perfectly cooked quinoa. - Asparagus - Great, nothing special- Mushrooms - Close second for vegetable favorite, prepared really nicely. - Crab Cakes - The dressing was really light and fresh, would recommend pairing a single crab cake with a vegetable for a meal. - Duck - Obviously really good, the best part was the sweet dressing over the duck. - (and the bread to start was really good, but that may be because I hadn't eaten carbs in so many days it could have been terrible and I would have loved it...., but I bet it still was good). - Apple Pie - AMAZE, the two other people at my party didn't like it as much, said it was a little dry. Again, maybe it was the fact that I hadn't eaten carbs in so many moons I was over the moon about it, but paired with ice cream, the apples were so sweet and the crust was cinnamon-y and flaky. Overall, if I go back to DC, this is where I'm making my reservation. FYI - I just saw it was rated by zagat as having the top 10 best fries in the US, didn't try them but they must be good??",Molly S.
666,Alexandria,2016-03-09,i5VD0AJcCcSbOp7qG5AJ5g,5, VA,"I took my wife to Blue Duck Tavern for her birthday, and we were both absolutely blown away by both the quality of the food and the service.From the beginning of the meal, our server Shankar was absolutely phenomenal. He wished my wife a Happy Birthday, told us a bit about the kitchen (we had a great view from our seat), pointed out the customized ""Happy Birthday"" menu and was just outstanding through the whole service. He made excellent recommendations, was engaging and friendly, and paced the meal very well. He was easily one of the best servers I've ever had, and I highly recommend requesting him for your special occasion.Now on to the food:We decided to order the bone marrow dish as an appetizer and both thought it was outstanding. The meaty flavor and delicate texture of the marrow was the perfect topping for the crostinis, and the size was right on. It was also so much fun to eat! We also ordered the braised beef rib, roasted duck, fries, and Brussels sprouts. Again, each dish was wonderful in its own way. I'm objectively not a great food writer, and I realize that a lot of my effusive praise may be lost on the 'food writer,' but I can't emphasize enough: Blue Duck Tavern is not only one of the best meals and food experiences I've had in DC, but also *ever*.We both really enjoyed our evening, and I'm so glad BDT, and especially Shankar, made my wife and I feel so special.",Adam T.
667,Kips Bay,2015-01-17,ZsrWK-kAJ0VRurBjWjCQJg,4, Manhatta,"Came here on a last minute trip to DC. The bf and I didn't have reservations but a friend highly recommended this restaurant so we decided to check it out anyways. Suggestion for people who don't have reservations...they have a lounge area that serves pretty much the same menu and its first come first serve!We arrived at the restaurant around 6pm and was able to find a seat easily in the lounge on a Friday night. The service was excellent and the food was delicious. We started off with the crab cake and bone marrow. My bf said the crab cakes weren't better than the ones we've had in Baltimore but it was still tasty. The bone marrow on the other hand was so good. The order came with 3 pieces of bone marrow and each piece had more than enough marrow for us to generously spread over our toast. The order also comes with a huge clove of baked/grilled garlic. The garlic is cooked so soft that you can spread it on the toast with the bone marrow for an extra kick of flavor. Compared to all the other orders we've had of bone marrow, BDT's is definitely the one to beat. I highly suggest trying their bone marrow!For our entree we shared the suckling pig, their BDT fries, and a side of their cauliflower gratin. The suckling pig was very tasty and the meat was nice and tender. I didn't care too much for their fries but I overheard the customer next to us talking about it and it's supposedly a healthy take on fries. The cauliflower was baked with cheese which you can never go wrong with. And for dessert we got the apple pie (for 2). We barely finished our dinner but forced ourselves to order the apple pie since that was what everyone recommended. The apple pie is definitely worth trying. The order says its do 2 but I think it can easily feed 3 or 4 after a filling menu.Overall this restaurant was delicious. It was a bit pricey but I would recommend everyone to try it! I would definitely come back to BDT if I was in town again.",Julie Y.
668,Arlington,2014-09-19,iDmqMhDF9OG0WialvFR70Q,3, VA,"I was really excited to try Blue Duck after hearing rave reviews and doing some uber thorough Yelp research. Unfortunately, it just fell short. The restaurant is modern and pretty, with an upscale vibe and dim lighting. Great for a special date night. However, when we showed up (btw it's really difficult to tell where to enter the restaurant... we ended up awkwardly walking through the open kitchen.. oops), the hostess had some trouble finding our reservation. When we were finally seated, the waiter took so long to come take our drink/appetizer order that we actually debated getting up and leaving! I'm not sure if he was just overloaded with tables or what, but it was a very noticeable delay. The bread and butter were both cold and stale-tasting --not a huge deal, but this was something i took note of because I usually think that great bread/butter starter is the first impression patrons get of a place, and the first sign of a truly great restaurant.  We ordered the scallop carpaccio for an appetizer... It was good, but a little fishy for my taste (probably because of the roe on top). Comes with 4 pieces, so pretty small. For our entrees we got the beef ribs and the wagyu beef, with a side of the potato puree. The beef ribs were delicious!!! Great sauce, great flavor, and very tender. The wagyu beef, however, just wasn't very good. It was tender, but not exceptionally so (not $36 so), and the sauce that came with it was too sweet and tangy, which was odd. The potato side was good, nothing extremely special... but buttery and garlicky and smooth. Definitely enjoyable. For dessert, we got the profiterole. I must admit I was full by the time we selected dessert, but nothing on the dessert menu stood out to me (which is not normal, considering I am a self-professed dessert fanatic). The profiterole was just okay. Overall, dinner at Blue Duck was a nice experience. The slow service picked up as the meal went on, which was good. The food was good but not 5 star good, and certainly overpriced for the taste and portion size. I'll probably give the restaurant another try sometime in the future to see if maybe I just ordered wrong or went on an off night.",Amber G.
669,Stanford,2014-07-22,EoDXRKVoCVd1v2zg7naj2A,5, CA,"I debated over whether to give this place four or five stars. I know some of my fellow diners would without a doubt give five given that two of them claimed this was, in their opinion, the best restaurant in DC. For their sake, and because I did enjoy my meal, I decided five stars it is!Located in the Hyatt, BDT has an interesting setup with an open kitchen layout where you can see the chefs busy preparing misc dishes and rushing back and forth. Getting reservations here was near impossible and we were fortunate to somehow get off the wait list to be seated at a community table on a Saturday evening. However, as the other half of the table never filled not was the table behind us full, I question their RSVP strategies.Nevertheless, I will say I like the layout of the seating. Our area was rather secluded between a mirrored shelf of wine glasses and racks of neatly arranged wines (probably way out of our price range). Our server was also enthusiastic about introducing the menu - we needed up pretty much ordering everything he recommended.To start off, bread and butter. I wish the butter had been softened as ours was rock hard and very difficult to spread. I was thankful for the bread though as we later needed it for our appetizers, the foie gras and bone marrow. Coming from a person who doesn't really enjoy super fatty texture, the bone marrow was not my favorite dish but I completely understand how others would appreciate the way it melts in your mouth and the nice crunch of the salty parmesan roasted on top. I also appreciated the roasted garlic served with the bone marrow, though I'd recommend spreading it sparingly as the flavor can overpower the bone marrow. The foie gras too was a very decadent dish, and I'm happy it came with a strawberry jam which offered a bit of sweetness to cut the richness of the foie gras. I do wish there had been slightly larger pieces of toasted brioche - how do you eat all that foie gras on three little triangles of bread? Again, this is where the complimentary bread came in handy.Onto the main courses. I do have to note that BDT took a ridiculously long time to serve between taking away our appetizers and bringing out the entrees. We waited at least half an hour, maybe more, before the food was delivered. That being said, some of the dishes were great. My favorite by far, and luckily the one I chose to order, was the duck breast. The meat itself was so tender and yet the skin was crispy and perfect. I really enjoyed the tomato purée garnish and rhubarb butter as well - definitely spooned a lot of that onto my duck. The leg confit was also amazing. Super rich and crispy, though significantly saltier than the breast portion.My friend's 12 hour pork was also fantastic. I personally am not the biggest fan of pork and even I enjoyed the crispy exterior topped with some type of seed. The meat was also very tender enough to be pulled apart by a fork. Definitely a well done dish. Less exciting was the tuna - I really wasn't a fan of the eggplant purée. In terms of side dishes, the fried green tomatoes were the best of the three we tried. The tomatoes themselves were decent though I like founding farmers' version better. What made this one amazing was the cheese and jam dipping sauces - what a great combination! All in all, we spent about $70 a person because of drinks, appetizers, and side dishes. The price tag will probably keep me from going back for a while, but if you have the money and a discerning palate, Blue Duck Tavern is worth a visit!",Helen Z.

671,Cherry Hill,2016-07-06,hmmpzZKyN5KmjZjnrCB7bA,3, NJ,"We arrived here after checking into the Westin across the street. We were seated in the open sitting area because we had no reservation. There we found a nice table with surprisingly comfortable stools. I had the soft shell crab for appetizer and Doug had the Farm lettuce salad. My crab was very good and his salad was exactly what it said--just lettuce. I thought that the $12 price tag was too much for lettuce and a dressing that he thought was too salty. I ordered the Pharaoh Roasted Quail--which was ok, the faro salad that it came with was pretty good also, it didn't wow me but it was satisfactory. Doug had the wood fire steak and he thought it was solid. We shared corn bread and the collard greens. The collard greens had a  fantastic flavor but the cornbread was underwhelming. I washed my food down with a Pink Lady and that was fantastic, Doug had an old fashion, but he's not much of a drinker so he ordered a soda. I tasted his drink and it was pretty good. Desert was the star of the meal by far. Days later and I'm still drinking about it. I had the Chocolate Guinness Brownie and it was delicious. The Guinness ice cream was to die for and I don't even like beer. Its flavor balanced very well with the chocolate. The whipped ganache was so creamy and rich. If I didn't live in NJ I'd go back often just for that.I wouldn't go back for the service, however. No, we didn't get bad service per se but our server (a woman with long blond hair) seemed very indifferent. She would disappear for very long periods we waited for a very long time before she came to take our drink order. And then waited for her to take our food order (when she did she approached the table and said, ""Are you ordering dinner.""--it was abrupt.

They give you SO MUCH. It was actually TOO much. Loved the truffle crust and roasted garlic.For entrees we ordered the delicious crab cake and braised beef rib. Both were excellent and cooked to perfection. Dessert was the best part in my opinion. We ordered the apple pie with honey vanilla ice cream. The waiter comped our apple pie because it took so long for them to bring it out. Great place for a nice dinner.,Jennifer C.

So good that we had to start eating with ours hands. Service was fantastic and very helpful finding us a wine that met our needs and helping with my wife's gluten restrictions.

676,Silver Spring,2015-10-25,ttEPMx4IXU4f3KGmUa1mVQ,5, MD,"Maintaining a 4 star yelp rating with over 1,000 reviews is no mean feat, especially for a fancy, expensive restaurant like Blue Duck Tavern. BDT deserves every star!Husband and I came here for brunch with a gift certificate from a friend. I can't usually afford this level of deliciousness, but if I could, oh, I would be at Blue Duck Tavern every weekend. The service was impeccable (which means not just flawless, but friendly and genuinely interested in our happiness), the decor was beautiful and comfortable, and the food and drinks were both surprisingly creative and surprisingly delicious. I recommend the mimosas, made with champagne, a scoop of sorbet, and a rock-candy stirring stick. Husband would recommend BDT's version of an eggs benedict, with house-made pastrami and pickled brussel sprouts - all of which sounds like it would be a bit weird, but it was perfect. If you are looking for a wonderful dining experience, you should go here.",Tara S.

On a Monday evening, we were able to snag seats for 2 with no problem.  Don't visit this place without ordering the bone marrow, it's THAT good. I'm not a big bone marrow fan but the bacon butter and pistachio crust combined to create a very delicious dish.  We also had the duck prosciutto, roasted suckling pig and french fries. Everything was served beautifully, but nothing was as mind blowing as the bone marrow.  The only thing I didn't like were the fries as they were thick and dense. The pastry chef served a sampling of complimentary chocolates - a great way to end the meal!",Melissa W.

679,Arlington,2015-10-04,Ae3WaIckFmm5Xr83YUuixA,5, VA,"Was taken to the Blue Duck Tavern by my wife for my birthday; we were chatting with the waiter after he found out we were local residents and he (facetiously) asked us why it had taken us so long to stop in. I told him I didn't have an excuse, but I was sorry it had taken that long, and I kinda meant it. Dinner was great. We tried some of the things that always show up on yelp like the apple pie (worth the hype) and the braised beef rib (*really* worth the hype) but honestly, everything they brought us was worth eating and paying for. The chef surprised me by being so multi-talented - not just with ingredients, but with philosophies. We were served two salads - one was an old favorite done better than I've had before, and the other one was both really innovative (think carrots roasted in coffee) and really minimalist (half a dozen fresh ingredients you could taste and enjoy). I'm a bit down on the menu structure - I like how you can have a complete meal of whatever you like instead of having the chef pair, for example, a meat and a vegetable; but a consequence is that it's hard on small groups. A complete meal ends up being a lot of food and a bit more on the bill than you may prefer; I wasn't sorry we got anything, but I was worried they'd need a forklift to get me back out on the sidewalk. Setting was nice without being frilly or frumpy. They have a nice, clean, subdivided dining room; the place built to a pretty good roar during prime hours, but nobody was seated so close that you could listen to their conversation which was nice. We had a pleasant, personable waiter who introduced himself as CW and who was encouraging, attentive to just the right extent, and seemed like he had a personal stake in us having a great meal - just a very pleasant human being. Overall, I'm an instant fan; I am definitely planning to go back, especially in summer where their patio is open and my favorite vegetables are in season. Unsolicited footnote: My personal opinion is that the place is more accurately described as being in Foggy Bottom or the West End (it's on the east side of Rock Creek) than in Georgetown. It's about two blocks north of Washington Circle.",Nathan D.
680,Jersey City,2016-03-14,uWV-YkbhFCpe_x5Xw1Q8tg,5, NJ,"There's nothing better than eating an amazing meal with a magnificent view of the kitchen with loved ones except for when you add in 5 star service and the perfect champagne.  I just wanted to thank you for helping to make my mother's birthday the best birthday that she's had thus far! As soon as my mom saw my brother at the table, she began to cry. Having him surprise her by flying in was the best birthday gift EVER. Once she dried her tears and hugged us both, we were ready for our culinary journey.  From the champagne toast to start, the menu that said Happy Birthday (that she got to keep) to the customized cake at the end and every moment in between (especially visits from Chef Frank), my mom couldn't have felt more special. The view of the kitchen from the table was great, the staff was so warm and kind and of course the food was absolutely delicious. We dined family style and ordered almost everything. We started with Scallops that melted in your mouth and Crab Cakes that were scrumptious. Then we shared braised beef rib, roasted Rohan Duck Breast, and Lamb Shank accompanied by White Corn Polenta, Crispy Brussel Sprouts and Roasted Wild Mushrooms.... Each bite was better than the last. Now, you might think that we were ready for dessert, BUT we decided to try the wood oven-roasted bone marrow (which was delightful) before ending with an incredible birthday cake made by the very talented pastry chef who we watched for a little while as we exited. (My mom said she'll be back for apple pie because it looked and smelled divine!)I can't thank you enough for making our night special in every way!!! I wish that I could give them 6 stars!",DC G.

686,Roswell,2015-05-27,vEFluGqs1hpqlsW_2z5GQQ,5, GA,"My wife and I had a wonderful dining experience at the Blue Duck Tavern. I found this restaurant after doing some research on Yelp and around other sites. We were celebrating our 2 year anniversary so proper preparation was a must. There is not much that can be said that has not already been described but I will say I agree with most of the positive reviews I have read. BDT is located a few blocks from Georgetown and encompasses a corner half within the Hyatt hotel. The expansive dining room kitchen and bar are all open and displayed as you walk in the large double front doors. The spot is beautiful and unique that keeps your attention during your stay.  The hostess was friendly and accommodating. She even remembered it was our anniversary on the way out (sometimes it is the little things in hospitality that go the longest way).  At dinner our meal was started off with complimentary champagne..yes please! This was a nice gesture from the staff and we appreciated it greatly. The menu is ever changing and vast. Lots of choices with accompanying descriptions and locations of origin will await you. Everything we tasted was incredible but I will say the head cheese stood out. It was smoky, savory and BBQ esque that was really satisfying. Our waitress for the evening was helpful without being pushy and made our night special. We actually enjoyed sitting near the kitchen and watching all the dishes being prepared. So many good things to say about Blue Duck Tavern!",Ben T.

689,Washington,2015-11-15,Wm5iFQSw3IHSBgFQgaTu0w,4, DC,"I've heard about Blue Duck Tavern, but it's taken years for me to make it out there. I went with my boyfriend for his birthday dinner on Friday night. I almost couldn't get reservations when I made them 3 weeks ago. BDT is one of those hot dinner spots on a weekend evening in DC.The restaurant is located at the Hilton in West End, and it's quite lovely at night.We were seated by the window, but I wish I had been seated by the kitchen. Their open kitchen is lit compared to the dark dining area. We were seated a little after 8PM, which was our reservation time. I wish the server had warned us about how much food we were ordering because we over ordered by a lot. We had two appetizers: the Wood Oven-Roasted Bone Marrow and the Roseda Beef Tartare. I would fully recommend the Bone Marrow if you like the fatty, garlicky, salty delicious combination. The Beef Tartare was not impressive. The entrees were the Cider Braised Lamb Shank and the Roasted Rohan Duck Breast. At this point, I was already pretty full. It was getting difficult to completely enjoy the rest of the meal. The Duck Breast was tender, and the sauce was a perfect match with the meat. The Lamb Shank came with a pea salad, but I didn't think the dish was memorable. With the entrees were the three sides: the Hand-Cut BDT Triple Fries, the Sour Apple Brussels Sprouts, the Roasted Wild Mushrooms. Out of these three sides, the mushrooms were amazing. I will come back and eat these again. It comes mixed with Olive oil croutons. The Fries and Brussel Sprouts were nothing special. For dessert, we had the Apple Pie, which came with ice cream. It has this crust that completely makes the dessert. The server was really kind and gave us some Moscato for my boyfriend's birthday. The service was pretty good. I will definitely be back in the near future.",Margaret W.
690,Washington,2014-02-09,LKXUaD68SR0jCu3BSYA3-g,5, DC,"I was fortunate enough to be invited to breakfast by Elite Yelper Melinda ""Vanilla"" C. and I gladly accepted! We parked on street (though we later learned we could have had a validation if we'd used the valet) and were promptly seated by a window in the salon. I love having a meal in the comfy-shmumfy chairs (here's looking at you Corbo E.). It makes it more like eating at an old friend's house rather than as a part of the food and beverage program at a major multi-national hotel. Fortunately, the servers found the happy medium between those two nuances. Everything was perfect. Prompt. Professional. Precise. From our 'order taker' to our 'food mover' we were well looked after at most times. We started with the pot of coffee. It was amazing. Super hot. Rich. Flavorful. Dark. Cream was delivered with it and the table was set with a myriad of sweetners (lucky me). Filtered water is the norm here and never ever runs dry. I ordered the hot Pecan Rolls, Chesapeake Bay Scramble, Creamy Gouda Grits, and a Pomegranate Juice. Everything was delicious. The pecan rolls came out first. Ooooh. These were nothing like ""Cinnabon"". And you can forget about those plastic shrink wrapped ""Mrs. Freshley's™ Pecan Twirls"" available in grocery stores near you.  These were hot and fresh from the oven; dripping with caramel glaze, pecans perched perfectly on top. There were two in the order. For the sake of the rest of the food I ordered, I only ate one at this sitting. To be perfectly frank, after a piping hot pecan roll, a couple of cups of coffee, and a taste of Cottage Cheese with Fruit Compote on top, um, I was kind of reaching the point of satiety. But when my crab & eggs arrived, I pressed on. Oooh the jumbo lump crab meat. The egg whites. The spinach. The avocado. The chives. Mmmm. I just had to dive in while it was hot and fresh. Get a forkful of that and a forkful of grits and you're in heaven. Wash it all down with a few sips of Pomegranate juice? Trust me, you're really in heaven. I will definitely return to Blue Duck Tavern for other meals. I'm a fan![Original visit Saturday, February 1, 2014.]",Kelly G.

I knew this place was pricey so we were all prepared to spend a pretty penny.We sat down and our server tells us about the soup of the day. Mushroom soup... with bacon. Yes! We put in our orders and then he comes back and tells us that they are out of soup but they have celery soup... Umm, no thanks. I wish he would have known that the mushroom soup was out before telling us about it. That was the first disappointment.The second disappointment was with our server. He was bland with no personality. I told him that it was my birthday and he responded 'oh, really'. I know it is not their jobs to be excited and interested but I am a personable person and I like to engage with my server. He was not engaging and could care less that it was my birthday.Wine... I ordered wine and he poured. I asked if he could pour a little bit more and he did. I was excited because I thought he hooked me up because it was my birthday. No, I was charged for an additional  1/2 glass of wine. I don't mind being charged but the way it went down, we all thought he was giving me a bit extra because it was my Bday.I ordered the duck with barley risotto. I hated the barley risotto. The texture was disturbing. When I hear risotto, I think of cream, smooth texture and moist grains. The barley risotto tasted like couscous. No Bueno. The duck was COLD, lacked flavor and it was not moist. Every meat dish we had lacked flavor or could have had more flavor. I ordered cauliflower and they never brought it to the table. My friend ordered brussel sprouts and they never brought it to the table either. She had to ask if they planned to bring it out.For the price, I want more creativity from the kitchen and exotic ingredients. I wanted more rich and bold flavors. Sadly, I believe this place is mostly hype or I came here on a really bad night.I could go on and on but to sum up my experience.... I was not impressed.",Shellie D.

My spouse really enjoyed the bone marrow, and it was for sure something different to see on the menu, and the pea salad was actually quite good, but everything else was pretty meh. The crab cakes were standard, nothing special. The apple tart was also overly bitter. Could have used better apples. The one last thing that likely detracted from the meal was the placing of our table. The layout of the restaurant is quite odd, and we ended up at a table that felt like it was in a hallway. A little odd. I would go again if someone really wanted to, but otherwise I'm not sure.",Trish J.

We had a ginger beer drink in a copper up which was delightful. Crab cakes were excellent, salads were fresh and tasty. We normally don't order dessert, but we shared the house special which wound up being on the house.Our server was perfect. When we return I would ask for him again.

This place is definitely worth the price tag. Mouthwatering items that you must try include:  * Bone marrow - their version remains the best tasting one I've ever had! Perfect to spread over the bread  * Suckling pig - just melts in your mouth and the seasoning was not too salty  * Braised Beef - super tender with just enough of the delicious sauce  * Apple Pie - ever since I had this one I started comparing other apple pies from other places to it and nothing has come close. Def the best I've ever had.Drinks here range from normal DC prices to a few thousand dollars for wine...,Jam C.

I was celebrating a friend's birthday dinner and she was treated like royalty from beginning to end. The attention to detail was amazing. My friend had a happy birthday menu made specially for her (which she loved). Our purses were on the table and our server came around with small table-side stools for us to rest them on to create more room on the table! Speaking of servers, Shankar and David were so hospitable. They were very friendly and inviting and did a wonderful job explaining the menu items. The food was superb! Everything that we ordered on the menu was made to perfection. I had the braised beef rib that was cooked for 18 hours, tender would be an understatement.

It was walking distance from our hotel so we walked there in the cold weather. It wasn't that bad of a walk. It is located at the Hyatt Hotel. The entrance very pretty and the restaurant is very elegant. Make sure to dress up. We were so unprepared since we made last minute reservations but they were very welcoming and made us feel comfortable. I love the Open Kitchen!! Such an amazing experience to see everything that is going on. Very clean and professional. The dining area is small so you are very close to the kitchen. Nice atmosphere and you can here everyone in the kitchen. You can't help but observe them. The waiters are all dresses in suits. To start off I had a Shaved Root Vegetable Salad with Meyer Lemon Vinaigrette. I love the lemon flavor it is sweet and sour. It was so good that we were craving more. They also have a bread station where you can see them cut the bread and bring it over to your table. It was delicious. I also ordered a signature margarita on the drink menu. It was delicious. The best drink I had in DC. For dinner I ordered the Half-Roasted Organic Chicken with Escarole, Garlic Confit and Chicken Jus. The chicken skin was crispy and the chicken meat was very tender and full of flavor. My fiancé ordered the 12-hour roasted suckling pig with baby vegetables and pork jus it was so good. We ordered a side of daily harvest vegetables. We were very happy with everything we ordered. Service was beyond great. Everyone was so helpful and I love that they help each other out. I noticed if a waiter was busy with a table and your food was ready immediate another waiter would bring your food to the table. They really care about the customer.

In the Hyatt lies Blue Duck Tavern a fancy pretentious place but still worth a trip. We ordered a sticky bun which disappointed as I thought it was be just like the sticky buns from Boston. I informed the waiter about it and he was more then gracious to switch it for something else but that wasn't necessary though I appreciated the gesture. We are not high maintenance people. We also ordered the bone marrow spring garlic butter, the lump crab cakes and the short rib hash. If you get anything definitely get the Bone Marrow appetizer I have not had anything that tasty relating to bone marrow. I could have ate 2 or 3 orders of it.The lump crab crab did not disappoint as it was filled with just bites full of crab though for that price I was hoping it would come with some sides and not just two crab cakes. The short rib hash is good too but a little salty but definitely recommended. Overall this place is worth a visit and a wait.",Sam M.

711,Pittsburgh,2011-12-04,CPkY6Ob4eNrl6d9e0YBq5Q,5, PA,"4.5 stars.  I felt really underdressed for my dinner appointment with jeans and a polo shirt.  To my defense, I did call and confirm  the dress code was and they did said casual.  Maybe they meant business casual?  The Blue Duck Tavern is located inside of the luxurious, contemporary, and elegant Park Hyatt Hotel (rack rate of $490 that week).Romantic setting and well mannered staff constantly monitor your status to ensure optimal enjoyment.  No doubt, easy to say Blue Duck has 5 star service and a 5 star dining environment.The night's selection:Oven Roasted Bone Marrow w/ spiced pumpkin butter ($13) - three, ""halved"" bones with exposed marrow and seasonings perfect to bring out the buttery smooth texture of the marrow.  This bone marrow variation tops all other places I have tried it.Whole oven roasted fish ($30) - lightly marinated striped bass laid beautifully inside an oval, silver pan atop an ""egg yolk"" colored sauce.  Just as moist as steamed.Mascovy Duck (Duck Leg Ragout, Roasted Quince) - ($28) - This duck is lean, meaty and smoked.  The end slices were a bit tough and more chewy than I would have liked but overall tasted great.Champion collard greens ($9) - Flawlessly prepared and goes perfect with just about any entree' you order.Apple pie ($9) - Unique configuration and shape not to be confused for a massive cinnamon bun.  It was so huge that even two of us could not finish and took half of it home.I had a near perfect experience here during my vacation and would like to thank my fellow yelpers for this recommendation.",Ken L.

714,Vienna,2016-11-09,1ieao7mXWjMwsneovd9Ubw,2, VA,"We came to get a quick bite last night and I was not impressed. The two stars are only for service. The seafood stew we shared was not hot, and it's presentation was absolutely small and boring ($35!). I didn't want to make a fuss because I was enjoying company. In addition, we ordered the apple pies, and it was luke warm! Does the chef believe in hot food?I'm a chef by trade, and quite frankly,  with the ambience of the dining room, and level of service as well as paying top dollar for food, I expected more.",Erick H.
715,Las Vegas,2014-03-08,tFiz-0p3H-eBRR6k6yi13w,1, NV,"So sad to rate someplace that is typically so great as 1 star...  But, seriously, it is so well deserved at this point it's not even funny.Arrived to grab a drink and a sandwich in the bar.  Known for great food, nice place, and a friend works here. Why not, right?First I ordered a Blanton's on the rocks - sorry, sir, that's unavailable. No prob, I'll take a Basil Hayden's - 2 minutes later that's not available either. Third try - something like Woodford they finally have. Then, I decide I just want a burger and fries...  Nice, dry aged Shenandoah Beef with Maytag Bleu Cheese...  Yummy!  Sorry, sir, we have no burgers available at this time.  Really?  So it's ham and cheese or nothing for a sandwich huh?  Just give me an order of the crispy Brussels sprouts and I'll head out to eat somewhere else. At this point, I have to put something in my tummy or risk early drunkenness.  Somewhere under that cheese and lemon juice there ARE Brussels sprouts - but nowhere near crispy.  Mushy and drowned in lemon juice and cheese. The final analysis - if you want something casual go elsewhere. I think the focus is purely on the dining room and they pretty much want the rest of us to get lost.",Tom M.

Had reservations and when we walked in, there was no line but the hostess was taking someone reservation on the phone. She didn't look twice. Glanced at us and just went about her business. We waited for about 10 minutes or so with no attention from her. Yes, I know it's only 10 minutes, but I guess we're used to the NYC style service where the hostess actually greats you. I don't know, call me crazy. Order the following:Kale salad with chicken: salad was good; chicken was amazing! Literally amazing!Beef braised rib: great dish and would come back for it. Tuna (special): horrible. Too fishy and not exceptional grade. Had to send back. All in all, delicious and I would 100% visit again!",Klim K.

I was here for brunch with a friend and we got Pecan Sticky Bun, Coconut and Kiwi Sorbet Mimosas, BDT Brunch Burger, and Short Rib Hash. Which were all highly recommended from other reviews. I don't know if this was a particular instance, but the food and the experience was just HORRIBLE. The server forgot about the mimosas, and when he brought them, he brought the wrong flavors. I asked for the burger to be cooked medium-rare, but it came out rare - if you can call it that. It wasn't cooked at all, it was cold and dripping of blood. The sunny egg was broken and was cooked hard. My friend's Short Rib Hash was burnt, so much so that you can taste and smell the burnt food that we couldn't even touch it. Unfortunately, the server never came back to ask us how the food was or how we were doing. He came at the end to give us our check and didn't even comment on the plate full of food. The whole experience just soiled our entire day and our special occasion. I can't see myself recommending this place to any of my friends",Hillary L.

I told them that it's a birthday dinner and would like to sit close to the kitchen, and they put us at one of the best table to observe the kitchen business.We ordered:- BDT fries: not very impressive. The big fat fries were a little over fried, some of then were really hard- Bone marrow: the green sauce on top was pretty good. But overall, this was a very greasy dish. I felt so stuffed and overwhelmed after a couple bites- Short Ribs: the sauce was good and my boyfriend liked it - Special fish of the day - Ahi Tuna: a light dish with well flavored and cooked tuna. This was the only dish I liked out of everything we ordered- Grits: very creamy. The first couple bites were heavenly, but soon it got too heavy. We only finished half of the dishOverall we had a good time and our waitress was attentive. I'll consider this place again for special occasions.",Mel L.

It was a delight!We got to sit in this neat glass box with pretty wooden benches. They put warm pistachios on the table.

722,Fairfax,2015-03-29,vfSd8h2MQtqErNMWO0R9TQ,5, VA,"Hands down one of the top restaurants around! The open kitchen design makes this restaurant unique! The servers will drop knowledge on you like how your saliva will drop when you see the food coming out.  Here's what we ordered from a party of 3:Appetizer:1. Bone marrow - If you come here and you don't get this... Missing out! Really! You will be! 2. Mussels - the sauce = amazeballs.  Then the sausage and bacon bits they tosses in there makes you cringe as you soak up each bite.Entre:1. Braised Beef - GET IT. PERIOD. Don't believe? Scroll down to other lists 2. Duck - it wasn't as I expected, I've have a lot of different duck before but to be honest it wasn't what I had in mind.  The texture was a bit on the rougher side.3. Rock Fish (Special only certain times in year) - This one also fell on my top choice because I had a high expectation for it but I didn't taste anything too unique from it.  For the price I wasn't too impressed.4. If I had to re pick I'd definitely go with the Wagyu beef instead of the rock fish! Side:1. Fries - they said they submitted their fries for America's best fries competition so we had to try them.  The fries themselves were pretty good and combine that with the dipping sauce it comes with makes it a lot better.  Thumbs up!Dessert:1. Apple Pie - tip for you guys, ask if they can serve ice cream with it!  You will love how the ice cream and the apple pie combination!  Definitely a great way to cap the night2. I have no more room!  Next time!",Kevin Z.

We had the pork belly and bone marrow to start - both delicious and then the duck and lamb neck for mains.

725,San Francisco,2014-01-02,iC6dvUq3rztZmX4JRwzRgw,5, CA,"Everything about Blue Duck Tavern was nearly perfect. Beyond being a little inconspicuous hiding away in the Hyatt hotel, the meal was bliss. Service: extremely attentive. They did everything we were thinking before we could even ask and sometimes before we were even thinking it ourselves. For example, as the sun was shifting it started to get a bit blinding, yet they lowered the blinds before we even needed to ask. Our waitress was extremely helpful and forgiving. Ambiance: extremely clean, bright, and well-maintained. Loved that they had you walk through the kitchen to reach the restrooms. A little strange, but a testament to how open they are with their cooking process and cleanliness. Speaking of the restrooms, I realize they seemed shared with the hotel, but they were the cleanest restrooms I have seen in a very long time. Food: we ended up here for brunch, and everything delivered. We got a wide assortment. The tuna in a chorizo stew was nicely cooked, light, and well flavored. The Belgian waffle was also delicious. We got multiple sides from Brussels sprouts, to roasted veggies, to the hash brown and the sautéed mushrooms. Everything was nicely prepared. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the sausage that came with the breakfast biscuit. It wasn't bad, just meh. Otherwise, all prepared and presented wonderfully. The coffee, which I drank black, was also bold without being burned. OH! And the CRAB CAKE. I don't even like crab, and this was AMAZING. One of the best things I have ever eaten at any restaurant - ever. Oh oh! The pumpkin flan! To die for. The pumpkin seeds on top were a perfect addition. Parking: I easily found street parking less than a block away. Lots of meters and a few free streets. I'm sure the hotel also has a valet option. Overall it was a great experience. They knew exactly what to do the entire meal, and even offered croissants on the house to begin with as well as the hash brown (since the duck fat fries that we ordered weren't available due to a quality issue - yet another indication they are very careful in their serving of food!). Will be back ASAP for lunch or dinner.",Nick H.

Unfortunately somehow my waffles came out rather cold, but it still tasted amazing. The wait staff checked in to see how the food was, and when I told him about the lukewarm food, he promptly got me a new dish.You can also order tea from the Tea Cellar, and the menu was extensive and I thought the price was very reasonable.

727,Washington,2014-03-30,8x5R7GtiuH4ucqk69_g7Yw,1, DC,"I'll start on a positive note. The people who work here are very accommodating and friendly. Even as I accidentally stumbled into the kitchen while searching for the entrance to the restaurant from the inside of the Hyatt, one of the line cooks graciously led me to the hostess, who promptly sat us.The first thing I noticed upon sitting is that I felt like I had been dropped at a randomly placed table in the middle of a cafeteria. Total mood killer - don't bring a date here, come with estranged acquaintances or your boss, or anyone you don't really want to talk to. It was really loud, and I was seated directly in front of the open kitchen area, which was just awkward. I ordered the kale salad, which was a few pieces of kale covered in dressing and cheese and nuts. If I wanted cheese and nuts, I would have ordered that, not the kale salad. I sent the salad back, asking for less dressing and toppings. The waitress was very nice about it, and quickly brought out another salad. Still a lot of toppings, still no kale, but edible. The special fish of the night was swordfish, my favorite. Can you mess up swordfish? Yes, especially if it is not fresh. My fish was bland, despite being covered in a mysterious yellow sauce and garnished by mushy over-cooked spinach. Oy. I ate about a quarter of it. The side dish of wild mushrooms was delicious. Order that. The bread was good, but not warm. The waitress awkwardly asked me if I hadn't enjoyed my meal, to which I kindly responded, No, not at all, actually. She sent over the manager, who proudly explained that all their food was fresh. I disagree, but he was generous enough to comp my meal, and even gave me his card so that the next time I come, I could contact him directly for a reservation. I don't think I will be returning, as the issue wasn't about getting a reservation, but about the terrible food and the rambunctious ambience. I don't understand the hype about this place.",Nadine C.

An hour and a half wait at 1PM. We ""Yelped it"" though and found this Amazing place to eat instead. Thanks, Yelp! Seriously, we enjoyed our brunch here so much that we joked about staying here and just eating dinner here again a few hours later. NOWHERE we ate at in DC was as good as this. I wish I could tell you exactly what we ate, but I'm writing this review a month later, back home in Florida. And I didn't take notes while I was there.  Sorry!

We ordered the bone marrow as a starting appetizer, as highly recommended. Did not disappoint! Probably one of the best I ever had. One of my friends always orders a chicken dish. That's how she determines if a restaurant has great quality food. The Organic Chicken was cooked to perfection. So tender and juicy. I ordered the Seared Scallops, which included pork belly, peach, heirloom pepper, Steen's Cane Syrup. So good. I usually order wine when dining out, but their cocktails were so hard to refuse.

I took my family here for their birthday dinner (April babies...while I'm the lone September baby) and it exceeded our expectations. The service was just incredible...they treated us so well! The food was perfect.Appetizer - Bone Marrow - I've had bone marrow before at The Purple Pig in Chicago and meh I wasn't blown away by it then. I decided to give it another try and I am so glad I did! This bone marrow dish was PACKED with flavor. It came with four slices of bread and as soon as we finished those...our waiter immediately brought us another plate of bread. Entree - 12 hour roasted suckling pig - Omg..melted in my mouth. The meat was so tender and juciy. The skin was amazingly crispy. Also packed with flavor. My mom got the braised beef rib, which was also really good (but I liked my dish better). My sister got the fish of the day (tile fish) - she loved it, but I'm not a big fan of fish. Sides - Wild mushrooms and potatoe puree. Delicioussss! I loved the different type of mushrooms they put together. The potatoe puree was so good - not too heavy. Dessert - My favorite part of any meal. I could eat dessert all day. We ordered the apple pie, raspberry panna-cotta, and vanilla ice cream. The apple pie was soooooo good and I'm not even a big fan of pies. This was extra flaky and the caramel glaze just made it over the top. The vanilla ice cream paired great with it because it wasn't too sweet. My sister loved the panna-cotta - with layers of streusal. It was a lighter dessert that wouldn't really please those with an enormous sweet tooth. The ambiance was great - very cute restaurant in the Hyatt. It has an open kitchen which I thought was really cool.I can't wait to come back! :)",Jennifer N.
734,Crownsville,2015-03-28,IjCxodUxlkwWfq8epivh7w,3, MD,"Stopped by here on a whim last Friday. The location is really cool inside. I was first attracted by the completely open kitchen a feature I always love in high end places. We were seated right away without having a reservation. At first, I thought our waiter was just great and super attentive. That is until it was time to order. Seemed like he didn't expect us to know anything about food which can be helpful if you ask or very insulting if you don't. This case was the later and it continued the rest of the night. It made eating very stressful because I felt like our waiter was judging us everytime he walked past. Regardless of that part of the experience, the food was excellent. We had duck fat fries, which were really filling; The bone marrow topped with herds, which was some of the best that I've had out; the rabbit tagliatelle, which was very very rich but good; and, the suckling pig, which was so yummy and came served with the cracklings.

EVERYTHING was phenomenal from the decor to the bread & butter (cranberry walnut bread with pumpkin butter for the season) to our meal to our drinks to the service. They had printed Happy Anniversary on our menu and then our server, Frank went above and beyond to make us feel special. He brought out complementary butternut squash with our meal and champagne with our dessert. Since the bone marrow was all over Yelp reviews, we started with that and were not disappointed. It was so buttery soft and flavorful. We also got the duck, butcher's cut, mushrooms, and apple pie with homemade ice cream. The apple pie says for two but really could be shared by four so prepare yourself! It was so good but we were also surprised by how good the ice cream was as well! Frank told us that 90% of the food is made in house, including the ice cream.

Be it that our decision to dine here was last minute, we took our chances, although there were no reservations available via opentable. We arrived around 8:30 and were greeted by a very pleasant host. Knowing that we wouldn't be able to sit right away, we headed to the bar for a few drinks and appetizers. The bar area is very quaint and cozy. The bartenders were accommodating and friendly. Their specialty drinks are amazing and I liked the fact that they had a basket of fresh garnishes that were only made to order. We were taken to a table less than an hour later. As we walked to the dining room, we passed an open kitchen, which I enjoy. It adds a very rustic feel to the ambiance of the restaurant. Our server was attentive and pleasant thought the course of the night. Everything that we ordered was nearly perfect, including desert (warm apple pie with honey gelato!).

Blue Duck Tavern was high up on my list to try after several glowing recommendations from friends. We joined two friends for brunch on Sunday, and were thrilled with the service and the food. While the ""farm-to-table"" is generally overhyped, BDT does a good job of letting you know what farmers they work with and where your food comes from. More importantly to me, they do a good job of making that food taste good. The eggs benedict was delicious, the burger looked amazing (though strangely open-faced), and our friends said their food was equally as delicious.

I thought the flavor was good, but a bit too much on the salty side. I couldn't eat it without the bread. We had the dry aged burger next. It was a bit difficult to get into - I had to eat it with utensils and it fell apart as I was cutting, but I found it satisfying (too full by that point). I still want to come back for their lunch or dinner menu.  As far as service, the starter came out fairly quickly, but we had to wait quite some time for the burger and short rib hash. We also had to wait about 15 min for a table even though we had reservations. They did have a nice waiting area near the bar, though we only realized it after 5 min when seeing others heading over there as the hostess didn't tell us about it.All in all, I'd give it an overall 3.5 for the price, food, service, and ambiance. I'd come back to try other items on the menu.",Yueh Yee W.

They do offer valet parking, which is a plus because finding parking in the area is pretty tough. I had the duck breast and the fries, both of which were excellent. I'd highly recommend both of them! The duck was cooked to the perfect amount, although the raspberry coulis was a bit overpowering. The fries were cut into thick rectangles with crispy exteriors and soft interiors. As our waiter put it, Blue Duck Tavern's fries are like a combination of standard fries and mashed potatoes.I look forward to coming here again!",Rachel G.

I would have preferred being seated in a quieter area given how many available tables there were. We got the Maryland crab with egg whites which was AMAZING! We also got the Belgian waffle because who doesn't want Nutella and bacon in a waffle? I would ask for extra strawberries and Nutella on the side next time. For our anniversary they brought out complimentary champagne and pastries! That was a sweet surprise :). The service was great!,Monica S.

754,Washington,2011-10-23,AAYjMG6KsyiWep-p6McEGQ,5, DC,"Duck fat fries.  Bone marrow with crostini.  Braised beef rib.  Bruleed foie gras.  Need I say more?  Went here with a large group for my birthday this year and had a fantastic experience.  First, this place, which is located in Foggy Bottom, is just beautiful.  There is an open kitchen, which you must walk through to get to the bathroom.  I must mention you also get escorted to the bathroom here -- fancy!  Service is exceptional and even if food were mediocre, I'd still return to this place for great service.  Lucky for them, the food matches in quality.  We had a family style meal and tried multiple items, but the aforementioned items are the must-haves.  Dessert was such a treat.  As the birthday girl, I was served their Maker's Mark flambeed chocolate cake with caramel sauce on the side and that was to. die. for.  Everyone at the table agreed it was quite orgasmic.  We also tried their famous apple pie and it definitely deserves all the hype.  The crispy crust really makes it.  Lastly, we tried their sorbet and that was not as memorable as the other two, but good nonetheless.  If you're trying to plan a date with someone very special, a birthday dinner, or a celebatory dinner in general, please do consider Blue Duck Tavern -- it is just a phenomenal place.  I will be back soon.",Cathy H.
755,Washington,2014-02-17,qaqEOG9CmcVxNNDKi2UkRQ,3, DC,"Every single thing I ate here was amazing, including the scallops, acorn squash, and cauliflower. But the beef tartare really stood out--I didn't want it to end.The only bad part of my experience here was the staff. When I arrived (in the blustery freezing cold), I was trying to change out of my tennis shoes and into my heels and the hostess literally accosted me about my reservation. #1, I just wanted a minute to get myself together. #2, I had told her I'd like to wait for the rest of my party. #3, I didn't know the name the reservation was under because I didn't know everyone in my party, and yet she proceeded to read various reservations that it could be, which I still didn't know and became visibly flustered that she wouldn't just leave me alone. When my friend arrived shortly after, I said, ""Excuse me, I think we know what the reservation is now."" The hostess completely ignored me.Then the waiters. 4 of us were drinking wine, and yet the waiter topped off the other 3 people at the table THREE TIMES before I literally stared him down to add to my glass, at which time the bottle was empty. And I felt continually rushed the entire time to eat and leave the table. When you have a table with a bill clearing $500, you don't rush them out of your restaurant. Only moments after we declined dessert, a bill was placed on our table. Only moments after the bill was placed, a waiter came to pick it up, with clearly nothing in it--followed by the ""my apologies, I thought it was ready,"" to push us to take care of it. Only moments after paying the bill, when 2 of us still had wine in our glasses, the entire table was cleared, down to the last napkin. And this was only about 8:30 on a Saturday--it's not like we were keeping them from going home.Even though the food was delicious, I will definitely not be back to drop such a large amount of money to be treated poorly by every staff member in the restaurant.",Shanna E.
756,Arlington,2015-02-19,a_wxBkxoKc_hqcNVi16UKA,5, VA,"Top notch dining experience.  The service and the food are out of this world good.  We made reservations for dinner but showed up an hour early and were seated in only 15 minutes after having a few drinks at the bar.  Even the bartenders were great - very friendly and attentive.For appetizers, we had the wood oven-roasted bone marrow and the smoked beet salad.  The portions are big enough to share. The flavors are incredible and I would highly recommend them both.  The couple sitting next to us was afraid to order the bone marrow, so I reassured them it was delicious and let them have a spoonful of our own before they ordered one for themselves.Our waitress, I think her name was Gladis, was fantastic. She showed us how to prepare the bone marrow and eat it properly.For entrees, we ordered the Wagyu beef (medium) and the beef rib.  They were extremely tender and cooked to perfection. You could have used a butter knife to cut through both.For sides, we tried the brussels sprouts, wild mushrooms, and triple fries.  Our favorite were the brussels sprouts with the cranberries... so so good!  The fries are cut extra thick and they are served with a mayonnaise based dipping sauce which is also pretty tasty.

758,Falls Church,2015-04-24,jep6NnLmr_GKuMDUZb1KFA,4, VA,"My review is pretty long so if you're not interested in reading all of it, just read the last paragraph. My girlfriend always mentioned that she wanted to go to Blue Duck Tavern because everyone of our friends raved about it so I decided to celebrate our 4.5 year anniversary with a fancy dinner here.  (Don't bother me about 4.5 years cuz it's not the full year. I wanted to CELEBRATE IT!) Anyways, the location is pretty discrete as there isn't a huge sign telling you its BLUE DUCK TAVERN and the fact that its connect to the Hyatt or Hilton (one of the major H hotels but definitely not Holiday Inn).  The ambiance was super fancy and luxurious.  Make sure you get reservations.The Food: We order the Bone Marrow appetizer, Roast Duck and Wagyu Beef as our entrees, and we added on Grits and an order of asparagus as our sides. Our dinner was supplemented by Braised Beef (read below as to why).The Verdict:Bone Marrow Appetizer - pretty freaking bomb!  If you've never had bone marrow, its pretty freaky and weird and gelatinous.  If was super flavorful and was accompanied by a full bulb of roasted garlic and some nice bread.  You definitely gotta get this just to try.  If you don't like it, please message me in Yelp and I'll gladly come pick it up.Roast Duck - the appearance wasn't the greatest I've seen. The taste wasn't the greatest I've tasted.  I'd say it was mediocre at best but the skin was pretty crispy and juicy.  I'm a fan of roasted chicken/duck skin so it's hard for me to say it sucked.  Regardless, I probably wouldn't get this dish again as it was pretty bland.Sides of Asparagus and Grits - MEH. I've had better.  I also had WAY better for 9 dollars/side.Wagyu Beef - as my review of Ruth's Chris stated, my gf and I are huge fans of steak (its whats fer dinner). We ordered medium rare hoping it was that melt in your mouth wagyu experience.  HOWEVER, the dish itself was SUPER chewy.  I really never had a piece of beef that chewy in a restaurant before. It was hurting our jaw and we decided to inform our waiter of it.  He was really polite and took it right back and replaced the dish with Braised Beef.Braised Beef - not the greatest, not worth $25+, BUT a good replacement to our rubber beef.  Blue Duck Tavern, from my opinion, is pretty overrated based on the food that we received.  Maybe it was because it was a Tuesday night but overall, I was thoroughly underwhelmed by the quality of food other than the Bone Marrow.  However, I will say that the overall dining experience brought my rating up from a 2 to a 4 because of our waiter.  If you ever decide to go to Blue Duck Tavern,  Wayne is the guy to dine with (bald caucasian male).  I will honestly say that he's probably the best waiter I've ever had.  He replaced our Wagyu Beef no questions asked and even talked with the Chef as to what went wrong and provided us with all the details.  Our replacement dish was provided literally a minute after he took the Wagyu beef back.  To top it all of, we were not charged for the Wagyu Beef OR the Braised Beef.  If only all restaurants can have a Wayne like that... If you ever every eat with Wayne, you will not be disappointed. Tip him and tip him well.  #inwaynewetrust",Willis P.

I know what you're thinking, oh my god, such dorks. But hey, Pi Day is a rare day so why not. Anyway, while looking up places for pie, I stumbled across Blue Duck Tavern. How did I miss this place as one of our dining options to begin with? Luckily I stumbled across it so I didn't miss out. Called them to make a reservation and barely made the cut. The host was able to squeeze us in for a late night dinner. Upon entering the restaurant, you get an immediate view of their open kitchen. I love this layout for a restaurant. The ambiance is lovely. There is a warmth that is very cozy and welcoming yet also very classy. The place seems open and huge with a high ceiling.  Braised Beef Rib- A nice portion of delicious meat. It is tender and flaky that you barely need to use a knife. The flavor is delicious, although a tad on the salty side. Accompanied by a few carrots so you don't feel like a complete carnivoreRoasted Muscovy Duck Breast with Kumquat Marmalade- I had a bite of this and thought it was a very unique flavor. I've had many variations of duck but this is the first time I'm having roasted duck breast with kumquat. The kumquat adds such an interesting flavor to the dish.  Apple Pie and ice cream- Ah, this is indeed the best way to end a day, especially on Pi Day. The pie is a good size, even if stated that it's for 2. The crust is delicious and flaky. The apple filling was perfect- flavorful, tender, yet still a tad crunchy. This is delicious when eaten with ice cream. The service here is fantastic. I would definitely come back again the next time I'm in town.",Cathy Z.

Over a thousand reviews with a four star average and all kinds of accolades led us to decide on Blue Duck and it did not disappoint. The roasted squab with foie gras bread pudding was simply stellar. Perfectly roasted squab with its crispy exterior and juicy interior (that sounds dirty, but oh well!) is probably the best squab I've had anywhere. The foei added the perfect balance of richness to the roasted squab. This is the one ""must-try"" dish at Blue Duck. The bison hangar steak served with braised red cabbage is another stellar dish...the bison just melts with one bite. We ordered other dishes such as the charred kale caesar salad,crispy sweetbreads, brussel sprouts, and the roasted duck breast. All dishes were excellent.Speaking of drinks...my Pomme Pom cocktail was beautiful to taste and look. Gin, calvados, and pomegranate make a great combination. We went with a bottle or pinot noir for our dinner, which paired perfectly with all the courses. While most of the dinner was excellent, desserts did not match up to the main courses. In fact, they were so unimpressive that I forgot what we had. All I remember was one was a hazelnut dessert an the other was some kind of cake.Memorable dinner but forgettable desserts. Go for the roasted squab and bison steak and get your dessert elsewhere. I am definitely going back for the main courses.",Krsna V.
763,Washington,2013-06-18,oLnFMKM0lLq4JV4hQCtqwA,3, DC,"Blue Duck Tavern is a highly regarded hotel restaurant located at the Park Hyatt in the Georgetown section of DC.  The exterior of the hotel offers a preview of the need to either to go to an ATM or use plastic to pay for this dining experience.  Once inside the restaurant, the decor fits a lot of descriptions- sleek, sexy, intimate, modern and clean.  They also add a great touch by having an open kitchen and pantry for patrons to watch the staff in action.The hostesses are professional but also give off the ""this is an exclusive place"" sort of vibe.  The servers are not only professional but they're refined, accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu.  Our server in particular went above and beyond to make us feel special.The restaurant bills itself as offering American fare using high-end ingredients.  They also promote creating many if not most of their products in-house and using local ingredients when possible.  Interestingly, the food was a mixed bag, which sucks considering the prices.  For starters and sides, we had the Cucumber Gazpacho, Hand Cut BDT Triple Fries, Mixed Greens Salad and Potato Puree with Soft Garlic.  Our entrees were the Braised Beef Rib and Crispy Skin Salmon.  For dessert, we had the Passion Fruit Tart and Apple Pie. The cucumber gazpacho was a major fail and that's being generous.  It was much too watery and the flavors were primarily limited to pickled cucumber.  Additionally, while they attempted to add some other texture components with some croutons and cheese, it was not nearly enough considering the size of the bowl.  The dish sorely needed some seasoning and greater depth of flavor.The hand cut BDT triple fries are known for being fried in duck fat.  Another fail, especially considering the hype.  These fries were definitely large and thick but they were dry.  The fries also lacked seasoning.  The dipping sauces for the fries were garlic aioli and a house made ketchup, both of which had very little flavor as well as a thin, runny consistency.  The duck fat fries at Bourbon Steak are so much better that it's not even a competition.  The mixed greens salad came in a moderate portion size and was dressed with a house made champagne vinaigrette.  I have a pet peeve about salads served with too little dressing.  Making matters worse, in addition to the taste of bitter greens, I asked for and received an additional side of the vinaigrette....and it was horrible.  It tasted like olive oil with a hint of vinager.      The puree was BDT's take on mashed potatoes.  It was light, airy, and buttery.  Unfortunately, it had the texture of baby food.The veggie risotto features Carolina gold rice, green spring vegetables, chanterelles and tarentaise cheese.  The dish was a little disproportionate with the veggie to rice ratio.  It was heavy on the peas and beans however the flavors were pretty balanced.  The cheese was strong enough to stand up on its own.  My only complaint is the restaurant should let the risotto set before serving it otherwise patrons end up with runny risotto.  The salmon dish is served with sorrel cream and cucumber smoked trout roe.    The only drawback is the dish comes in a small serving size.  The seasoning was just right and the crispy skin offered a nice texture element.  The salmon tasted fresh and was properly cooked.  The roe is more of an acquired taste.  Overall, definitely a good choice.The braised beef rib is served with a housemade steak sauce.  It came in a moderate portion size and was super tender.  In addition to such tenderness, it's moist and packed with balanced flavors that also allowed for the natural meat flavors to come out.  The housemade steak sauce had a little bit of tang and was good as a steak marinade however it was reduced down too much.  There is a theme with the sauces at BDT- so thin.  Nonetheless, this entree was exceptional.  The Passion Fruit Tart is served with toasted meringue.  The portion size was definitely shareable and the dish was beautifully presented.  The passion fruit flavor is assertive and is a great palate cleanser.  I wouldn't say this dish really fits my preferences but it's a decent dessert.  The Apple Pie is said to be the most popular dessert at BDT.  It's basically a miniature pie as opposed to an individual slice and definitely big enough to serve 2-3 people.  The crust of the pie is excellent.  Moist, flaky, firm on the outside and soft on the inside.  The apples tasted fresh and tart.  The drawback is there wasn't much sweetness coming from the dish and the apple filling was on the dry side.  The honey vanilla ice cream is a great complement to the pie as it has balanced flavors and smooth, creamy texture.Overall, Blue Duck is a nice upscale restaurant, particularly for special occasions....but is overrated given hype and very high prices.  That said, it's worth a visit, especially if someone else is paying!",Mo A.

Anyway, we started off with the seared foie gras and braised lamb. They were both amazing. These are 5 star appetizers right here! For the main course, I ordered the wagyu culotte of beef. My parents got the muscovy duck breast and the free range chicken and lobster tail. All 3 dishes were good but I had higher expectations after the superb appetizers. Remember to get sides because the dishes just come with meat. We got wild mushrooms and fries. I wasn't a big fan of the fries. They're jumbo cut; I prefer smaller fries. To finish off we got apple pie and 2 scoops of ice cream ($3 per a scoop). It was good, but too much... We couldn't finish it all.

Reservations were booked until 10:30 however they mentioned they have bar and lounge seating so I tried my luck and it paid off.First off, the lounge space is very large. So if reservations aren't available during your target dinner time do not be deterred. The Good: the food. It's delectable. I shared a bone marrow and braised beef. Both were absolutely delicious. I recommend putting the marrow on top of the braised beef. Incredibly savory and great texture combination. The ambiance is very nice and grand. It reminded me of a French kitchen mixed with modern flare.The service is great. Attentive and knowledgable wait staff.The bad: the menu is a bit limited. Really one dish per meat. Also, $20 for a side of veggies. It's a large portion but the price point was quite high.The ugly: The wine prices. The markup on the bottles that I recognized was between 2.2 and 2.6.

770,Honolulu,2014-01-31,L4PRVnkR_ofKOi7FirTvDA,4, HI,"Cyndy's Bottom Line:  Service and food was great except at the front of the restaurant.  They need to keep the male host and get rid of the hostess with the bad attitude. Looking back at my previous visit to Blue Duck tavern it was the front of the restaurant that ruined everything.  We arrived early and started with a drink at the bar.  The bartender was very attentive and friendly.  We mentioned that we were headed to the Mariinsky Ballet at the Kennedy Center to which she replied that it would be no problem getting through dinner in the time frame we had.We were seated near the open kitchen which was kind of fun watching the action.  Our waiter C.W. was very accommodating especially when we mentioned that we were on our way to the Kennedy Center.This is what we ate:Hand Cut Wagyu Beef Tartare, Black Truffle, Crispy Winter VegetablesThis dish was well composed starting with bed of potato on the bottom, followed by delicious wagyu beef, topped with a little frisée, a perfect egg yolk on top, a generous amount of shaved black truffles and sprinkled with potato chips.  Yes, potato chips!  What a delicious tartare!  I'm dreaming of eating this again!Smoked Trout - Crispy Potatoes, Pear, Gribiche Spiced Pecans.Hubby enjoyed the trout.  It was smoked perfectly and the skin had a flavorful crispiness .  Tartar sauce added another layer of flavor.Duck fat fries - C.W. was nice to suggest having the fries with our entrees while I was thinking of having it with our appetizers.  The fries were ok not the best duck fries I've had.  It wasn't moist potato on the inside with a crispy crunch on the outside.  I prefer a thinner cut fries dusted with rock salt.  The fries needed a dusting of salt although the aioli was a great accompaniment.Braised Beef Rib with Housemade Steak Sauce.The braised beef ribs lacked depth of flavor and moistness.  The ribs were a bit overdone and dry to me.  The flavor of the steak sauce was ok a little better than A1? Skate cooked in a razor clam sauce.  This was the special of the night.The skate was cooked to perfection.  The razor clam sauce was flavorful and delicious.  This was an excellently done fish dish.",Cyndy K.

It takes me a long time to make up my mind so this extra homework is needed so I don't drive the waitress crazy with my indecisiveness. I loved everything I read on yelp. I wanted so badly to love this place but my experience fell short of my expectations.Let's begin on a high note. The bone marrow was the highlight of my evening. Absolutely delicious and worth every penny. the roasted garlic was a bit overcooked. No longer nutty but approaching dry and flavorless. This still didn't matter because the bone marrow was that good.Now for the lows. I ordered the duck and my boyfriend had the crispy salmon. Ugh, I hated them both. While the duck had a lot of flavor I just couldn't get past the thick layer of fat that was not successfully rendered. Let's not go there with the salmon which was bland and had an unpleasant vinegary finish. My boyfriend is a lot nicer than I am so he painstakingly kept his. The server was very accommodating so he allowed me to change my dish for the scallops.Unfortunately that is when things went from bad to worst. The scallops was so salty and the tomato sauce was simply unappealing. I only ate half of one scallop so that tells you what I thought of this dish. To be honest I could go on and on. The fries was tasteless and simply to thick for my liking and the ice cream was not rich and creamy like ice cream should be. I am a definite foodie but by no means a food snob. Good food is simply good food and nothing I ate equated past three stars. Nothing except for the bone marrow.",lyanna t.

The food, the service, the ambience - it was all spectacular.I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. We loved everything that hit our table.The service was incredible.

779,Brussels,2015-05-11,Rhc-cQzGdYm-M-E-hPqBkQ,5, Belgium,"I took my parents here for Mother's Day breakfast and it lived up to my (very high) expectations. I'm a big fan of the restaurant's aesthetic. It's pretty but also very spare in a lot of ways. It's not ostentatious or overbearing. I think it complements the food very well and puts more of the focus on the outdoor garden (lots of windows toward the front of the restaurant) and on the food. I enjoyed a nice hot pot of fabulous coffee, while my mother had a pot of Earl Grey tea that came with its own candle-powered heater. We also split a pastry order, with a muffin, a pain au chocolat and a croissant that we split into thirds. The pastries came with butter, marmalade and a berry jam that were all delicious.For breakfast, I had the pumpkin pancakes, which were to die for. They were very rich and made me feel full without being lethargic or weighed down. Very satisfying, and the cream topping and coffee crumble really added nicely to the flavor.My mother enjoyed a crab cake with egg whites, avocado and tomato, with wheat toast, while my dad had the Belgian waffle (with bananas and Nutella) with a side of pork sausage. Because our food took a while to come out, our server (and the service was excellent) comped us a side of hash brown squares. Everything about the meal with wonderful and it was a fantastic way to spend Mother's Day morning.",Kelsey H.
780,Washington,2016-09-14,BZZmspQD4Ty6jaAswfOK5w,5, DC,"One of my favorite restaurants in DC. Difficult to get a reservation, but well worth planning in advance. Great place for a special event or date because it is quiet and has a good atmosphere. The staff is truly superior and attentive. I appreciate how they take time to go over the menu with you and select the dishes and wine pairings. The bone marrow is a different and delicious plate to try. The apple pie for dessert is simply heaven.",Jackelyn K.
781,Seattle,2013-06-18,PK2v9bocU_ZtC-zbpYTZdw,5, WA,"The place is soo good I had to make it a regular place to eat while in DC!Here's what I've had:***Marinated Cucumber Salad, YogurtThis reminded me of eating cole slaw, but much better! The serving is quite small, and isn't a huge bang for your buck deal. ***Braised Beef Rib This is a very big block of meat to eat. Very much shareable among two people! Its tender, and goes great with the Potato Puree with Soft Garlic. ***12-Hour Roasted Suckling PigOne of my favorite items to order. It is so tender and delicious. There's a crispy layer of skin on top which has so much flavor. With 12+ hours of cooking, the flavor, texture, and taste is superb! ***Roasted Muscovy Duck BreastAnother item that I love ordering. The sauce compliments the duck very well. It's so well done, far, far, far better than the duck you'll get at a Chinese restaurant. Overall my two faves are the pig and the duck! The place is pricey, but well worth it!",Erin M.
782,Falls Church,2016-12-11,HU3ErWKyel8dFT7aHVCe0A,2, VA,"Six of us had dinner here last night. Service was mostly good. The hostess was lovely. One or two forgotten requests by the waiter. The food was hit or miss. My wife's lobster dish was cold when served. No comments at the table about anything being outstanding except for the Brussels sprouts and the fries. It was after 11 when we ordered dessert. I could see the dessert station from the table. Two people standing there doing nothing. After 20 minutes of waiting. I told the waiter to forget it and bring the check. If you're going to play at this level with the prices they ask then these kinds of misses are inexcusable. On the way home not one person spoke about how good the food was instead we talked about how over we all were with these trendy, hip farm to table restaurants. Needless to say this will be our one and only trip to Blue Duck Tavern.",Scott B.
783,Washington,2016-08-24,LwjYeKBQ2eKwAvcxXF4uWA,5, DC,"Oh Blue Duck Tavern, I've fallen in love with your bone marrow. How do you turn something so simple into something so luxurious?The staff is also great. They are very easy-going, attentive, and very knowledgeable about the new seasonal items on their menu. Their menu, though small, have a great variety. It has something on there for everyone. Every time I come here, my food is always so good that it makes me wonder if the other option that I was looking at could be even more delicious. What I love about Blue Duck Tavern is that they use very simply ingredients and make amazing dishes out of it. Every component of the dish compliments each other, and I walk out of there completely stuffed every time (but always wanting more). The ONLY downside is that the menus are seasonal so I can't get the same stuff over and over and over again, but none of the menus had disappointed me yet!",Anna M.
784,Washington,2015-09-21,ieCIS1PUHAjnefJQ0jiTpw,5, DC,"When I arrived at the Blue Duck Tavern, I immediately fell in love with their open-kitchen concept. A perfect marriage of rustic and modern, patrons' food is created out in the open for all to see. I literally walked through the pastry kitchen and a fresh batch of apple pies on my way to our table. As a food enthusiast, I loved the opportunity to get  an up close view of of the preparation and plating of the food. As an OCD clean freak, it was also nice to see the environment in which my food was being prepared. Blue Duck Tavern takes their level of accountability to a new level with their open-kitchen concept.As I joined my group (at the Chef's Table in a semi-private area of the restaurant), I immediately began perusing the menu offerings. I'm at a place in my journey with food exploration where I'm willing to try things outside of my taste palate at least once. When our group leader suggested ordering a few plates of the Wood Oven-Roasted Bone Marrow ($17), which they serve with everything bagel crust and spring garlic butter, for the table, I jumped at the opportunity to taste it. The perfectly seasoned marrow was loaded with coarsely ground spices and garlic and just might have been the most delicious thing I've ever tasted! I can't tell you how important it is to step outside of your comfort zone when visiting restaurants. The bone marrow is definitely something I would not have ordered on my own, but now that I've exposed myself to something new, it's an item I will continue to order if offered at a restaurant. Having passed through the pastry kitchen on the way to our table, I opted for an order of Pecan Sticky Buns ($10) to start my meal. Loaded with tons of pecans (that's pee-cans for us southerners, not pa-kahns) and drizzled in a warm caramel sauce, I ate more of the sharable starter than I anticipated.Having started with perfectly sweet sticky buns, I knew I wanted something savory for my main course. The thing I love most about dining with large groups is it gives you the opportunity to see (and sample) more of the menu. We ordered a wide variety of entrees including Baked Eggs ($16), the Buckwheat Waffle ($15), the Short Rib Hash ($18), Blueberry Pancakes ($15), and Shrimp and Grits ($20). Everything was fresh and delicious, and they stayed true to their mission of serving ""simple, rustic food with an artisan approach.""The Blue Duck Tavern is definitely on the higher end of the scale of restaurants. At any given time of the day, you can bump into the heavy hitters of the city there, but they manage to maintain a high level of decorum without feeling too pretentious. If you're looking to make an impression or celebrate a special occasion, it's the perfect place to be a little fancy and spend a lot of money. While I enjoyed the food and the overall experience, the one (and only) thing I did not appreciate was their primarily a la carte menu. At theses prices, I just feel like sides should be included, not something you have to order in addition to your entree. I'll definitely be back, in fact, I'm already planning to celebrate a special occasion with dinner there in the near future.Until next time, folks. Keep dishing!",Kathy R.
785,Palo Alto,2011-09-20,buHJpCaZJSq4YUqqftsyEA,4, CA,"This was one of my last stops here on my DC Trip and by far was one of the more satisfying dining experiences.  We had a reservation at 11 am but overslept and had to set a very late brunch/lunch at 1:45.  Located in the heart of Georgetown, what a great place to open up an upscale restaurant.  I ordered steak and eggs and straight out of the oven chocolate cake.  Both were extremely tasty.  The only negative was the steak was cooked a little too well done to my liking (asked for medium) and the cake had too much whiskey.Overall, great environment and ambiance into this place.  The staff is extremely friendly although they did not know they were featured on the Food Channel!  You get a clear view of the layout of the kitchen (it's gorgeous) and if you are looking for a fine dining experience, look no further.",Kevin C.

I have a hard time getting a table on the weekends then when I finally get table it's not even crowded. They have a spread of desserts for tea parties on the weekend. The waiters are completely different they are nice. The presentation of the tea is so nice as well. The atmosphere of the area is open and has great energy.

Started with the roasted bone marrow from their autumn menu they topped it with pumpkin butter and bits and pieces of granola.  This dish was excellent in both texture and flavor. I would come back just for this dish alone.We also tried the french toast with pears & apple which was done really well.  Our server recommended the short rib hash which was on the heavy side but the short rib was very tender.  The last entree we tried was the Eggs Florentine.  I was so full didn't get a chance to try but my girlfriends said it was good.  Would come back again when in town.,Stace C.

The cream cheese and avocado were nice, but I didn't really taste the crab. In my opinion the food itself was overpriced, but of course you also factor in the ambiance, and service etc -- which were all really good.Overall, our party of 5 had a good time.

I was extremely blown away with the impeccable service as well as the great food. I am an avid ""bruncher"" and the food here was next level. You MUST try the short rib hash, crispy chicken biscuit, and the sticky buns.

791,Arlington,2014-01-28,YauuToQb-WhrUs8bcSoRFg,4, VA,"This place is pretty awesome! Loved the inviting decor and open-kitchen style that made you want to explore further. We went here for date night on a Thursday and it was very busy but the service remained outstanding. It was our first Blue Duck experience so the server took the time to inform us about the format of the menu. To start off, we ordered their seasonal soup (which was a creamy mushroom soup) and it was very delicious. Very well seasoned with a nice little spicy kick to it. For the main dish we had the seared scallops and crab cakes with mixed green salad and roasted wild mushrooms. The scallops and crab cakes were absolutely phenomenal. The crab cakes had nice big chunks of crab meat. However, the braised endives that came with the scallops were bitter and had a really weird after taste so I did not finish it. The salad and roasted mushrooms were also delicious.The most important part - dessert. We shared the apple pie made for 2 with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a scoop of dark chocolate ice cream. The apple pie was nice and warm and tasted delightful with the vanilla ice cream. Both ice cream flavors were very rich and enjoyable.Overall, I had a fantastic experience, except for the fact that the seating was very, very uncomfortable. We sat in their section that has the long bench on one side and chairs on the other. I sat on the bench and the entire time I felt like I was either too far from the table or sitting on the edge of my seat just to reach my food and hear the conversation. We actually physically moved the table just so I could reach my food, but it was still very uncomfortable. I would suggest putting pillows along the back of the bench to make it more comfortable. Actually, just get rid of the bench.",Shiva H.

The restaurant is beautiful inside as well, can accommodate large groups and has a great ambiance. Everything we ordered from the starters to the dessert was excellent. The bone marrow was out of this world, as everyone else has said. Also had rabbit and the beef rib which were both excellent. The beef rib screams out for a good red wine to go along with it. Can happily recommend this restaurant as well as return here again in the future.",Robert S.

The food: the food was ok. It pains me to say that because I was super excited but it was just ok. The sticky buns I started with were warm and fresh but they weren't soft and flaky. The triple fried duck fat fries were good, probably the best thing we had. I had the smoked trout eggs Benedict as an entree. Again, it was good but...sigh. I expected more. Then for dessert I had a Nutella Eclair with gold leaf. I love Nutella so this was heaven. Our waiter was awesome and made the experience wonderful but for the price I expected more.",Ashlan H.

We realized that the hotel restaurant was one of the top ten restaurant in DC for 2013 so we felt a need to have breakfast here. So I had the espresso and my lady had a cappuccino and they were excellent. My espresso was nice n strong but not overpowering and her cappuccino was smooth, foamy, decadent. She then ordered the eggs Benedict and I ordered the deviled eggs with a pastrami salmon. She really really enjoyed the eggs Benedict and I thought my pastrami salmon was excellent. The yolk/paste in the deviled eggs went well with the salmon and pumpernickel. These guys are big in presentation and notes of flavor. And while the amount of food seemed a bit on the light side, I actually left pretty full. So overall, we really enjoyed that dining experience.

Bone marrow starter was amazing but with 4 halves of bone it was way too much for something this rich - amazing flavor though. Bison hanger steak was cooked medium rare to perfection, but again our sides were too large - ordered 3 for 3 people to share. Fries, grits and bean casserole.

But then he came back with our drinks and told us the specials, and I finally figured it out. As for the food, I agree with the other 5-star reviews.  The food was absolutely amazing.  From what I recall I had the charcuterie plate, a wonderful potato leak soup, roasted duck, and sorbet for dessert.

Having heard exceptional reviews about this place, I was extremely excited to be able to experience some of these great flavors the night after an exceptional dinner. What ended up happening was that Blue Duck set up a buffet rather than made to order, and put that forward for the patrons that were taking part of their New Years  morning breakfast. A bit disappointed to have my options limited, but regardless it was still an experience. The open kitchen dining experience was amazing, as a diner you get to step inside one of the most well run, and inventive kitchens in Washington D.C., and be able to experience not only the flavors, but the sights and smells as well. The buffet was set out in a side area, with highlights of thick cut bacon, chicken sausage, scrambled eggs, toast, waffles, grits and many more. While the offerings were vast, when I come to a place like Blue Duck Tavern, I want the tastes that made them famous, the complex's done exceptionally, the basics elevated, and this method or way did not take the meal to the next level I would expect from a place with the reputation of Blue Duck, this could have come from any buffet style breakfast place.

815,Arlington,2014-01-02,BOBHgj0HbAt8ZPpRVHNrCA,5, VA,"The Blue Duck is really good, and their duck is fabulous. Service was friendly, efficient, attentive, and courteous. I made a reservation for a group of four, and we were greeted and treated like VIPs even though we were not (ok maybe my guests qualify). The ice cream is a must try. Very good. And oh so humongous. It's not a dish but a huge glass of ice cream (several scoops) with a large wooden spoon. Naughty and elegant at the same time. Will definitely come back.When friends were in town we came here again for an afternoon drink, and the Blue  Duck did not fail to impress. Chic and stylish layout and design. Noise level and ambience just right. Service was a bit slow but OK. Salad super small (even for girly stomachs) though, so order something else if you want more than a bite. in the afternoon, in terms of food (to go with your bear or wine), they only have 1 page of uninspired ""all day dining"" consisting of the usual burgers, sandwiches and such. Regular meal times are their forte I guess.",Alice J.
816,Chicago,2014-08-12,nAfwzm_aEuZ_n5DraMnpzQ,4, IL,"I went to Blue Duck Tavern in a party of three. We wanted to relax and take our time enjoying great wine, great food, and of course great company. We got exactly that. The wine was expensive, we got the cheapest bottle and it was $60 but it was worth it as it was a very good wine; light body pinot noir with a plum sweetness. I had the roast duck and it was cooked flawlessly. The breast meat was tender and flavorful, and there was a little leg on there to give me an amazing taste of fatty goodness without the whole meal being that and destroying my health lol.Get an entree, and get a side or two. Portions aren't tiny but they aren't huge. We all shared an incredible sweet corn risotto with our entrees and with our appetizer and dessert (get the apple pie. Do it.) it was great. Service is impeccable, but not very personal. I think they are used to a clientele that wants a server who acts like the etymology of that word suggests... As a servant. I do not. I wanted to engage our server at least a little and make them feel welcome to stop by our table any time. He was there whenever we needed him, but only interested in taking our orders and explaining the menu. This is fine but I'd love for management to encourage a more engaged connection at least when the situation calls for it.I'd love to go back sometime! If you're visiting DC it's definitely a place you should stop in. Be prepared to spend $100 a head and just go to town.",Will C.

Cocktails and the amazing service this place is getting any stars. I had their version of a Moscow Mule and it was very memorable! The food was so overly salted that we returned almost everything. The staff handled our returns and concerns so professionally and they re-made a few items with less salt but that ended up extending our dinner longer than we anticipated. The bone marrow was inedible due to salt and they kindly replaced it less salt. Once the salt level had been fixed, it was amazing. The mushrooms, scallops, duck and steak were so oversalted yet they were so apologetic that we didn't end up returning those items. They gave us yummy sugar cookies to help make up for it, but sadly - I won't be returning to this restaurant.",Lee L.

We went for our anniversary, and while the experience was nice I wasn't blown away. Our food was good, although my husband's benedict was a bit cold and we didn't see what the fuss was about regarding the fries. I had been disappointed not to get a table outside since it was a beautiful day, so at the end of the meal we asked if we could take the remainder of the champagne we had ordered out to drink. Our server and another server or maitre d set us up on the front porch in the adorable rocking chairs in front of the hotel with an ice bucket for our wine and even brought out a complementary dessert to help us celebrate our occasion. The desert, a peach custard of some sort, was fabulous and easily one of the best things we had during our visit.Overall a great experience and I'll be back to try the dinner at some point.",Kacy B.
820,Queens,2015-06-08,ecLwifua410NnBL0i_2SbQ,5, NY,"My fiance had a wonderful dinner here on my first time traveling Washington DC for leisure on 6/5. We found this spot via Yelp and saw the amazing reviews. What locked it in was the bone marrow dish they had. It looked amazing via the many photos listed, but it was even better tasting it. It was well worth the travel into the area, though parking is a bit tough depending on the time since there's several hotels within the area. My fiance had the duck breast, while I had the scallops. The duck breast was good, but the scallops was truly amazing. We got the BDT fries, but personally it was not anything exciting. We ended up leaving majority of the fries to avoid the carbs. We also had the asparagus and shrimp salad and both were good. We ended the dish with the malt pudding and it was delicious. They also give us a little bag of sugar cookies and it was the softest cookies I've had. The meal was amazing and well worth the cost. To top off the dinner, we had a great server, Shanker. He was very friendly and provided great details with the recommendations. He was also very personable during dinner and gave great suggestions on local spots to visit while in the area. He was a pleasure to speak with and provided great service. Definitely a return spot if I'm in DC for business or leisure.",Johnny P.
821,Falls Church,2013-07-22,KCIDluZKpRaHmOH3OvCDiw,4, VA,"My BF surprised me with a late dinner at BDT and I was thrilled. We have both wanted to try this place for such a long time, that we finally took the plunge.  BDT is located at the Park Hyatt and has gorgeous, tall, dark wood doors that open in their open kitchen.  On our walk to the table, we passed by the dessert chefs and the fresh breads. We had the best table in the house, right in front of the kitchen, which is completely open, lit up, and gorgeous. We wanted a white wine, and the sommelier was kind enough to come over and recommend a few bottles to us.  We settled with the Cederberg Stellerbosch, a South African wine, which was crisp and a little sweet. For the food we got the asparagus with hen egg, which was yummy, but nothing too spectacular. For our starch, we got the grits with smoked gouda, and oh wow was it good. We couldn't get enough of it.  For our entrees, we got the suckling pig and the scallops.  The pig was delicious and the skin was so juicy and flavorful.  It also came with their daily vegetables. The scallops were amazing and cooked just. My only grip - there were only 3 scallops! Super sad. For dessert, my BF insisted on the apple pie, which was not just a slice, but a mini whole apple pie.  We also opted for the gelato (mocha, chocolate chip, and vanilla) and the goat's milk caramel sauce, which was to die for. All in all - the service was amazing, the food was delicious, the ambiance was dark and romantic, and it was a perfect date night.",Jackie N.
822,Arlington,2015-05-18,eGxpjz3T05fzw2O0twoKNQ,5, VA,"The Blue Duck is a glorious place if you play your cards right.  First off, you want to steer clear of the tables in the back near the open kitchen - unless all you want to hear is kitchen clatter.  In warmer weather, you can't beat sitting outdoors - the terrace/garden is lovely, with beautiful plantings (mostly herbs, some of which are used in the food) and even a duck splashing happily in the attractive fountain in one corner.The menu can be a little off-putting - a shade pretentious in the way that's so popular at the moment (I suppose it's interesting enough to know exactly what farm all one's vegetables come from, but it makes for a lot to read), but the food itself is delicious simplicity.  I don't know if it was unusual, but our recent Sunday dinner was a prix-fixe three course offering (the online menu is a la carte) at $85 per head, and while that's not cheap, what we had was more than worth it.  From a foie-gras custard starter to perfect seared scallop or wagyu steak mains, right through the celestial desserts (a perfect, and perfectly enormous, apple pie for two with the assorted all homemade ice creams and sorbets), we enjoyed every bit.  The mains were augmented by fabulous vegetables, including asparagus with cheese and a poached egg and carrots, served smoked and fantastic.We found the service to be extremely knowledgeable and friendly, and we were grateful that we were allowed a very leisurely (three-hours plus) meal.  Add in some terrific wines and an interesting cocktail to start, and I can't imagnie a nicer place for a festive spring/summer dinner.",Alex D.

Give 3 stars because of a yummy dinner I had last year -- steak and their once-famous Blue Duck Tavern (BDT) fries. I returned last month for brunch anticipating the fries, but learned they changed the recipe... Bad idea. They look different, taste different, and the dipping sauce is completely awful. Before it was a simple aioli, now a bitter-tasting red peppery-type sauce.  The fries before were heavenly.... So heavenly the cooking channel featured them on a unique eats episode last year. Good bye BDT fries. The bone marrow was foul. The double cheeseburger was overcooked, overly salted, and way over priced. The apple pie was dry. I wasted hard-earned money and my time.",Kim F.

828,Las Vegas,2012-12-15,WmIXT7eiA9PcwcfAdaGl8A,4, NV,"The Why:  Sometimes there just isn't enough time to visit all the restaurants that need to be visited during a short vacation and under those circumstances, particularly when planning around a baseball game (Steven Strausburg's first home run as it would turn out,) brunch with new friends, dinner with your uncle, and a Kings playoff game one has to make sacrifices...or wake up bright and early for a morning run, drive to DC, and 6:30am visit to the only Molteni range in town and a recently updated breakfast menu offering far more than the standard boring hotel breakfast.The Reservation:  6:30am - none needed - though I admittedly did contact the restaurant in advance with a very specific request; one accommodated without question - and with a big smile from the chef when I arrived.The service/setting:  Yes, it is in a hotel, but featuring dark woods and a wide open kitchen and pantry where the morning buffet is laid out the space at Blue Duck is anything but generic.  Clean lined and warm with plenty of light from floor-to-ceiling windows and with both indoor and outdoor options the restaurant feels rustic and modern at once without feeling forced at all.  Moving next to the service and bearing in mind both the location and clientele at The Hyatt my guess is that the servers are trained to be attentive without being personable, a fine attribute for the well-heeled hotel guests on both sides of me but a bit 'cold' to the solo gourmand more interested in the cuisine than 'the market.'  Taking into account the menu prices, partially influenced by the environs and in part by the sourcing to be sure I guess I would have simply preferred a bit of a smile or some cheer rather than the solemn 'yes sir' and 'no ma'am' solemnity from my server Sharihan and her team.The food and drink:  Coffee, one appetizer, one main course, two small complimentary pastries, and a special request to go.Coffee:  $5 but replenished before it ever neared empty this aromatic medium roast from Counter Culture was quite good, a bit of cocoa and a lot of fig notes plus a rich mouth-feel thanks to the French Press.Pastries:  Part of the $32 breakfast spread (or ""$10 for 3"" on the Pastries and Bread menu) but delivered to my table along with a quartet of preserves by one of the runners along with my coffee at no extra charge I did not see any other table receive these so I'm uncertain whether it was a comp or a mistake but either way the warm Blueberry Muffin and Banana Bran Muffin were both quite good; small enough to be eaten in a couple of bites, dense with fruit, and rife with butter - the banana particularly impressive and rich.Wood Fired Sticky Bun:  $8 for two and approximately 3-4 bites each these are the best sticky buns I've ever tasted by a rather substantial margin.  Light like a beignet but with a golden exterior rendered just a bit crunchy by the smoky maple glaze and nuts...seriously, just order them.  Fried Chicken and Waffles with Steens Pure Cane Syrup:  $15 and served on a stainless steel platter this was another excellent dish with both the chicken and the waffles crispy on the exterior and perfectly cooked within - each teaming with buttermilk notes and a great take on the southern sweet meets savory classic.  Served with Steens but also with Blis Bourbon Aged Maple syrup available I requested a bit of each and would personally recommend the Blis as it really brought out the brine on the bird while the sugary sweetness of Steen's personally made me desire-full of some hot sauce.Apple Pie:  $9.  Having already mentioned my call ahead request I'll just admit my gluttony right here and say there was no way I was leaving Blue Duck without trying their famous apple pie and although I guess I did technically 'leave' the restaurant before consuming the dessert I was glad the team was willing to assemble one from scratch for me at 7am, bake it, and pack it up in a thermal foil box to help it retain heat - a task it achieved admirably for nearly 2 hours until I sat down on a grassy hill in Logan Circle to enjoy.  Featuring a flaky butter crust, tender chunks of granny smith apples, ample cinnamon and brown sugar, plus a drizzle of apricot glaze this pie is every bit as good as the rumors and taken with a to-go cup of the coffee on the sunny hill a near picture perfect scene.The Verdict:  Professional, classy, and featuring high quality locally sourced ingredients in a truly beautiful space it would be hard to find any fault in Blue Duck Tavern save for service that was a bit less warm than the room or food would seemingly command.  Certainly not a 'cheap' breakfast but undeniably a place where you get what you pay for I wouldn't consider it an everyday indulgence but I would definitely recommend a visit to anyone considering it and will very likely include it on my list of spots to revisit for lunch, dinner, or perhaps just a dessert (or two) during my next visit to the capital.",Michael U.

830,Arlington,2014-11-06,fv7QHo7IBmnW3E5Am_pE_A,4, VA,I would give this place 3.5 stars if I had my way. I'm not saying this place isn't good but there are a ton of great places in DC. To start off with we had to wait about 20-30 minutes for our reservation and then our waiter was a little odd. The ambiance is great and would be a nice place to bring some clients or out of town guest for a nice meal. We had a couple apps but nothing was so memorable. I'd heard great things about the crab cakes so decided to give them a try- not to say they weren't good but i've had better on multiple occasions.

831,Edgewater,2013-03-10,mwLeaL-LWKCxlIfD_h3-Hg,2, MD,"So the ambiance and service was great.  Loved the super tall black entry doors.  Made me feel like a mini me entering some magical world.  The place was bustling even though it was early on a Friday evening.  I kind of had my heart set on what I wanted  to order as I previewed their menu on line and the day's specials were not enough to sway me from my original plan.  The meals here can get quite pricey as it is similar to a steak house with sides priced separately.  When a restaurant does this they better make sure EVERY entree is executed to perfection.  Sadly, Blue Duck failed here miserably.That said, the staff was really accommodating and went the exra mile to make sure we were satisfied. They offered substitutions and ended up taking two of our plates off the bill.  Thank you Blue Duck for not questioning my palate but sadly we did leave the restaurant hungry.The problems? First, the mushroom tart with spring salad promised a rich and woodsy bite backed with a buttery tender crust.   Instead, it was a one note taste of citrus that overwhelmed every other component of the dish.  Seriously, everything tasted of bitter lemon.  Two bites and done.  When the duck breast arrived, I didn't even have to taste it to know I would be severely disappointed.  Anyone who prepares duck knows how important it is to score the skin of the bird deep enough so that the fat underneath renders while cooking.  The skin on this duck was soggy and a clear line of fat was visible making the breast unpleasantly greasy and chewy.  Unfortunately, my partner's entree did not fare better but we did not want to continue voicing our disappointments, as it began to feel uncomfortable.  His rack of boar was pretty to look at but was so devoid of flavor that if we were in a blind taste test, we could not even venture to guess what we were eating.  We were told to expect no gaminess, but heck how about some porkiness?I know this place is loved by many.....we are just sorry it's not by us.",Regina S.

833,Tacoma,2014-11-18,yv75OA46rrh95tJDt1q4Ag,5, WA,"It was at this particular moment in my life that I thought life couldn't get any better. Flashback to last weekend on my 30th birthday trip with my husband to DC. The trip itself was fantastic, but what made this moment in time absolutely perfect was The Blue Duck Tavern. I have dined all over the world, but this place takes the medal for hands down the best restaurant I have ever been to in my entire life. From the moment that we called almost two weeks ahead and could only get a 5:45pm reservation for 2 on a Friday evening made me realize this place was going to be magical. Our plane was delayed so i called the restaurant and was able to take a 7:30 spot because someone had cancelled. Walking into the restaurant, I was taken away by the classy yet almost seductive atmosphere. The entire kitchen is open and the restaurant is fairly large. A couple of tips : Start off with the bone marrow! I had never had bone marrow before and probably would have never tried it until I saw the two other tables next to me with it and they were indulging so much into this amazing appetizer that we had to order it. I felt like an animal nearly scrapping the bones clean. It was that heavenly! The Scallops and Pork Tenderloin were the best dishes I have ever had at a restaurant before which makes me think that every entree is spectacular. Our wine list was amazing and service was impeccable. I cannot wait to return to my favorite restaurant in the entire world! It makes me almost want to take another trip to DC just to dine here.",Brittiany M.

836,Los Angeles,2012-12-23,_2nfXwlnHq9og8R11ZIPUA,5, CA,"Blue Duck Tavern was perhaps the restaurant I looked forward to most leading up to my DC trip. Having seen it on the Cooking Channel and read about it online, I dreamt about the food and, of course, knew exactly what I would order before I even walked in the door. In case you don't want to read the rest of this LONG review, here's the short version:1) The crab cakes were cooked perfectly.2) The BDT Triple Fries were good to try once.3) I think Jesus himself made this apple pie.4) PLEASE get ice cream on the side of the pie.5) Service and decor are spectacular.=================================================================And here is the long version:From the outside, you get a sense of the atmosphere with huge windows that peer inside. A dramatic, tall black and wooden door leads to the inside where you're greeted by hostesses who will gladly take your coat. This level of courtesy is extended throughout the whole waitstaff, which promptly fills glasses, discreetly folds napkins while you're in the bathroom, and delivers overall perfect service. While I wouldn't call this place fancy, it's definitely a splurge to go, and when you do go, you'll be surrounded by people celebrating an occasion or business men conducting professional lunches. The upscale atmosphere and impeccable level of service interestingly contrast the downhome theme of the menu. From each portion of the menu, you find simple American fare but expertly prepared, elevating familiar favorites to a level of decadence. Everything on the menu lists its origin of location, usually family-run farms and dairy producers, and is served family-style. I ordered and shared the two crab cake appetizer, with BDT Triple Fries on the side. The crab cakes were phenomenal, save for the 4 or 5 bits of shell I unfortunately had to pull out of my mouth. This would be my only complaint with my meal at Blue Duck Tavern, so maybe the chefs could work a little more slowly or carefully in picking out the meat. In spite of this, these crab cakes showcased the natural and subtle sweetness of the Maryland Blue Crab meat perfectly. Many people herald crab cakes with ""no filler""--I don't care about filler, just as long as it adds flavor and there isn't too much of it. These crab cakes walked that fine line successfully, using only a minimal but rich and flavorful binder. Pan fried, these crab cakes had a perfect golden exterior and just enough crispiness to contrast the tender interior. The BDT Triple fries are thick, cut by hand, and fried three times to get the interior fluffy and get a good crunch on the outside, fried in duck fat for extra richness and flavor and served alongside a thick garlic aioli; I was excited to dive right in. The fries were good of course, but I've surprisingly had better duck fat fries before. I thought these were cut a little too thick for my liking, but were enjoyable nonetheless. The garlic aioli was practically heaven-sent. Finally, as everyone on Yelp has said, a trip to Blue Duck Tavern is frankly incomplete without ordering the famous apple pie. Once again, Blue Duck Tavern takes a familiar American dessert and executes it better than I've ever had it before. I think the chefs made a great decision to prepare the pies small and shareable for a small group. Instead of serving a sloppy slice of a pie, you get to admire the pristine crust and sparkling sugar the Blue Duck Tavern's apple pie. Once you taste it, you'll know. The crust is buttery, rich, and not the least bit dry. The apples are a tart granny smith that hold up well to the sweetness. They don't become mushy in the baking process, thankfully, but still are just tender enough to contrast the crust. Interestingly, I could not taste a whole lot of cinnamon in the pie filling, but I really didn't miss it. In copious amounts, cinnamon can be quite spicy and overpower the subtle butter and apple flavors, so I can understand why it was used quite sparingly here. Honestly, I was not prepared to spend $9 on ice cream to put on the side of the apple pie. But, in a true display of the holiday spirit, my waiter brought me and my companion each a container of the housemade honey vanilla bean ice cream on the house, insisting that I simply ""had to have it this way."" Man, was he right! The cold and rich ice cream contrasted perfectly with the crispy crust of the pie and the tartness of the apples. It really was a match made in heaven. So, take my advice, get the ice cream, too; it's well worth it. I loved Blue Duck Tavern. I would come back for any meal. In fact, I've seen that they have a fantastic brunch on an episode of ""Best Thing I Ever Ate""--something to look forward to in my next trip to DC!",Patrick N.
837,Los Angeles,2013-03-31,ZCxOwqQT5Rp-vaWAy5orXg,5, CA,"A-mazing. Easter brunch was by far the best meal I've had since moving to D.C. Sure it's a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for. Easter brunch consisted of buffet style appetizers, an entree,  side orders, and buffet style desserts. Started off my eating marathon with oysters, ceviche, Maryland crab salad, and asparagus. For my entree I had the rock shrimp scrambled eggs with hashbrown potatoes and caramelized vidalia onions. For our side dishes we ordered their famous BDT fresh cut fries, champion collard greens, and roasted wild mushrooms with parsley, garlic, and croutons. For dessert I had tiramisu, a berry cream, a chocolate cake, and fresh strawberries and mangoes. And I washed it all down with a cherry blossom green tea. I know, you're all thinking where did it all fit? Well let me tell you people, where there is a will there is a way! The service was superb. Although we had a one waiter that was primarily attentive to our table, when it came time to serving food, each person in our party had their own server. Great service. Great food.

The presentation of the food is beautiful and the portions aren't too big so it's just right. The special truffle corn on the cob was amazing, definitely not cheap on the truffle as there was plenty to go around. Had the special tuna which I loved, it had a good smokey-ness to it. The steak was also cooked perfectly. At the end of the meal they give complimentary cookies, the sugar cookie was amazing but so was the blueberry.

The green apple sorbet was a miss, while being tart and refreshing it had that mealy mouthfeel of an past-its-prime apple which was a weird way to end a nice meal.

846,Alexandria,2015-01-06,FEv7uArO9eo20AUsnyMsrA,5, VA,"Blue Duck Tavern has the best Bone Marrow Appetizer, hands down in my book thus far.  It's so good that you don't even want to share it.  Everything is cooked to such perfection with mouth watering flavors.  It's no wonder that it was named as one of the top restaurants in the Washingtonian.  But to be honest with you, as good as our meal was, I would just go back for the bone marrow and not share a single piece.",Angie T.
847,Boston,2014-12-05,W8-VheBrUY_AavuGHukWQQ,5, MA,"Yep. What everyone else says.Blue Duck is one of my favorite spots in DC. Request a table on their garden patio on a warm evening. Every item on the menu that I tried is delicious. A couple of my favorites: - Bone marrow - yes! Split with a friend or two.- 12-hour suckling pig - stop it. Too good.Now stop checking Yelp, and hop in a cab to Blue Duck. Sit down in their stylish wooden chairs, put on a blindfold, and point to a couple random items on the menu. Tasty, huh?

848,Alexandria,2014-11-03,oaMlMiq8CjZfP1dMcVRajQ,5, VA,"My boyfriend and I came to Blue Duck Tavern to celebrate our anniversary and we were both so pleased!  BDT is inside the Park Hyatt (they have valet parking, FYI) and it is truly beautiful.  The restaurant has several open kitchens that you can walk through, which is pretty cool.  I really liked the lighting inside (ambient but not dark, definitely cozy) and the decor (we were seated near some beautiful quilts).  On to the food!We started with cocktails!  I had the Bliss Old Fashioned (really good, but a little sweet) and my boyfriend had the Smoke on the River, which had Chinese tea in it.For a starter, we had the charcuterie board, which featured the best chicken liver mousse I've ever had, duck rillette, whole grain mustard, radishes and butter, fig compote, carrot and beet pickles, and crusty garlic toast.  It was perfect and so satisfying.For entrees, I had the bison hangar steak with red cabbage and tobacco onions.  The steak was cooked perfectly and was so tender.  The cabbage was amazing, and the tobacco onions were crispy and addicting (zing!).  My boyfriend had the 12 hour suckling pig which came with roasted vegetables.  Our waiter, Wayne, stopped by every so often to drop little knowledge gems, like the suckling pig is roasted 12 hours (obviously), but what they do is debone the pig, then kind of portion everything out so that each serving has a little bite of each part of the pig as well as a piece of crispy skin.  We also shared an order of the triple fried duck fat fries which were out of this world!  The fries are super thick and really crispy, the aioli is very flavorful.  You MUST get them.  We couldn't finish the fries (we tried!), so Wayne suggested that we dice up the potatoes, fry them in a little bit of oil with maybe some onion or garlic, and have them as home fries in the morning, which sounds tempting.We were really stuffed at this point but we HAD to at least look at the dessert menu, and we were tempted by the Guinness ice cream, which had Jameson caramel, white chocolate ganache, and candied bar snacks (popcorn, potato chips, peanuts, pretzels).  It was delicious and perfect for splitting between two people who have just eaten a very large meal.We had such an amazing meal here, it was the perfect way to celebrate!  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Blue Duck Tavern",Katherine C.
849,Arlington,2014-12-11,2SoUwc6xmo4fTinnaAhTuQ,4, VA,"One of my best friends decided to have their birthday meal at Blue Duck.  The staff was nice enough to accommodate our large party of 10 people.Sadly, this was quite a while back so my memory is a little bit foggy.  However foggy as it may Blue Duck definitely stood outThis restaurant is a little expensive but it's also in an upscale nice neighborhood.  Very close to GWU and the trust fund crew.  I loved the modern and sleek interior decorations. I actually wondered around for a bit just check checking the place out.  I'm a nerd like that.The food is good but the portions are a bit small. I was able to score a nice veggie quiche for about $11 or $12.  It was a small sliver that was accompanied with a tiny salad it was delicious.  This really hit the spot after a recent tonsillectomy.  My friend ordered an iced tea. However this was no regular ice tea. For one it was $6.  It also came along with a small picture that was either simple syrup and some sort of sugar solution.  It looked really fancy and really cool.  Since I was on a low sugar diet. I just had a water.  I was definitely eyeing my friends gourmet iced tea enviously.I was also able to sample my girlfriends dessert, sadly I cannot remember it's name. However it had a base of carrots which I loved.  It was almost like some sort of yummy soufflé meets carrot halwa.  I'm not sure if she actually liked it as she was encouraging everyone at the table to try it.I guess the recipe selection Blue Duck is always subject to change. I will definitely be going back to explore more.If you're in the area come check this place out.  :)",Hana S.

851,New York,2012-11-03,XwMFFjhVCk1g3_Bz8A0s4A,5, NY,"To say my meal at Blue Duck Tavern was the best I've had in many years would be 100% honesty. Thank you Freddy Jr R. and Eric N. for being my escorts. I so appreciated the company, and being able to share such a wondrous meal.Libation:Blood Orange Martini: 5 stars. This is my new drink to crave. I would try to describe it, but I don't think I could do it justice. Just go and order one. You'll understand my loss for words when you do.Appetizers:Wood Oven Roasted Bone Marrow with Pepper Crust: 5 stars. Where has this been all my life? As Eric N. quoted Anthony Bourdain, bone marrow is ""God's butter."" Yes sir, it is, and I want some more. Bread will never be the same without it.Seared Foie Gras with Creamy Mushrooms, Hen Egg, Frisée, and Truffle Butter Bread: 5 stars. I only stole one bite of this, but it was every bit five stars. In that moment I completely threw animal rights out the window, and lavished in the awesomeness that is fatty duck liver. I may go to hell for enjoying it so much, but honestly I don't care. It was worth it!Entree:Wood Oven Roasted Scallops with Stewed Tomatoes, Pickled Mushrooms and Bacon Power: 5 stars. I have never had scallops prepared with such skill. To be able to maintain the subtle sweetness of such a delicate shellfish among acidic and smoky flavors, is worth far more than I could put into words. The creator of this dish took it on with just right amount of boldness and restraint. You have my applause Chef. Side:Hand Cut BDT Triple Fries: 5 stars. French fries will never be the same. If only I could eat these every day and not risk my arteries or my waistline, I would do it happily. These French fries are officially the only fries that I feel no need to dip in ranch dressing; which if you know anything about me, you'll know is saying something. Desserts:Chai Spiced Chocolate Cake with Rum Raisins: 5 stars. Pudding cakes can be very difficult to execute, let alone execute well. The pastry chef at BDT showed great skill with this beautiful cake. Not only did it maintain a velvety pudding consistency, but it's balance of sweetness and dark chocolate couldn't have been better, and was only enhanced by the chai spices. Perfection.  Pecan and Date Tart with Fig and Cognac Ice Cream: 5 stars. I would give the crust of this alone five stars. Add into the mix a pool of vanilla bean crème anglaise, delightfully creamy and slightly caramel accent of homemade fig and cognac ice cream, blending with the gooey awesomeness of roasted pecans and dates, and you'll get so close to a real ""When Harry Met Sally"" moment that you might just have to excuse yourself from the table after just a few bites. Had I not been in the company of two of Yelp's most genteel, I just might have let it out right there in the middle of the restaurant. Thank goodness for feminine self control, or I might not been able to come back for brunch later this month. ;)",Carly C.

854,Washington,2015-01-08,_PQ7NowppbDQ4X3RzrISWQ,4, DC,"My manfriend and I just celebrated our 2nd anniversary and for our anniversary dinner we went to Blue Duck Tavern. Blue Duck Tavern is located in the fringes of Georgetown close to the West End. It is part of the Park Hyatt Hotel. The atmosphere inside of Blue Duck Tavern is romantic with it's very sleek and modern furniture. There is an open kitchen and pantry (in fact you walk through the pantry to get to the bathrooms- a little strange if you ask me)Once we got to our table we were welcomed by our wonderful waiter who went over and beyond for us. He helped me make the tough decision between the wagyu beef, bison steak and the 24 hour crusted pork.  I ended up getting the bison steak which was tender but a little chewy and had a more gamey taste than regular steak (which I liked but may not be for everyone). My manfriend and I ordered a side of crispy Brussels sprouts. These brussel sprouts were the most delicious, amazing, phenomenal brussel sprouts I have ever had the pleasure of eating. There are pieces of bacon or ham in between them with a honey bbq mustard sort of sauces which is so delicious that when the sauce fell on my napkin, I did contemplate eating the napkin in order to get more sauce! I could go on and on about the Brussels sprouts but really the star of the night was the appetizer we shared. We ordered bone marrow. I had never had bone marrow before and was pleasantly surprise to discover I found myself a whole new food passion. The bone marrow was covered with a sauce which may or may not be butter based. It was served with delicious crisp bread to spread the bone marrow on. It was so goood. I mean I am closing my eyes just thinking about it. The apple pie which everyone seems to rave about is good. It has a really delicious crust but as another reviewer mentioned the actually filling is dry and leaves a lot to be desired. A big golden point to Blue Duck Tavern for serving us a very large ice cream along with the pie. I also ordered an old fashioned and was surprised by getting one of the most delicious old fashioned I have ever had! I have to agree with another reviewer that the BDT fries left a lot to be desired. They were very thick and dry. They had a lot of potential since they are fried in duck fat.",Simone S.
855,New York,2015-03-31,VraeSZOWIjpn6TFDGCY1Lg,4, NY,"Believe. The. Hype. This restaurant is the bomb.com and was the best brunch I've had in a while. We ordered some sticky buns to share, and I got the short rib hash with olive oil poached egg. Both were stellar, but the hash definitely took the cake--the short rib (that was apparently braised for 72 hours!) was incredibly tender and paired surprisingly well with the horseradish sauce, and the biscuit was nice and fluffy. If the hash were a tad less salty, it would've been the perfect dish. My biggest regret is not getting the roasted bone marrow dish because no one would share it with me, and I blame my friends for not enabling my unhealthy bone marrow addiction.",J C.
856,Washington,2013-04-03,nLOTOoaf-U7JMMEhj2vQwg,4, DC,"Definitely one of the best restaurants I have had a chance to visit.I really like the space, the open kitchen is awesome, I appreciate being able to see the staff working to prepare the food.  A couple of issues with the atmosphere is that the place can get very loud making it hard to talk to others at your table and also the chair arms are weak and appear a bit cheap.Service was very good, the main server as well as the assistant servers were all friendly and accommodating.  They were able to spell out all the specials and made me feel very welcome.Food was excellent.  I was able to sample several dishes and all were pretty good.  I started with the oven roasted scallops, they were cooked thoroughly with great flavor.  My only issue with the dish was the tomato sauce that accompanies the scallops and bacon was way too sweet for my taste, other than that I can not say anything negative about the scallop dish. I was also able to try the crispy skin salmon and once again cooked perfectly with excellent flavor, the sauce ready brought out the natural salmon flavor increasing my enjoyment of the meal.  For sides I tried the forbidden rice and sauteed mushrooms, both with great flavor, the forbidden rice had an interesting texture and was a new experience for me.  For dessert, I shared the apple pie with vanilla ice cream.  This was easily the best part of the meal, the apple pie was amazing, nice sized, excellent crust and perfect blend of tangy and sweet with the apple filling. Definitely an excellent place to bring a date if you want to impress or great place to go if you  want a great meal in a nice atmosphere.  A bit pricey but you definitely get your money's worth.",Chris S.

859,Fairfax,2012-12-13,AcOZEy4yUVEEVY-dT6xDlg,3, VA,"We had wanted to fall in love with this place judging from the menu, but our taste buds were not as happy as they could have been.  My husband brought me here for my birthday and this is what we ordered:  basil margarita, Perfect Pim's, seasonal soup - clam chowder, bone marrow, foie gras, duck leg confit/duck breast, braised beef rib, brussel sprouts, fries, PBJ Bar, chocolate banana s'mores, honey vanilla ice cream.Our all time favorite:  the foie gras!  It was the best we have had in the last two years (the other is from Mulvaney's Building & Loan in Sacramento, CA).  Everything on that dish was great.  Creamy mushrooms, goopy hen egg, toast with truffle butter - the foie gras was delicious.Second best was the deconstructed clam chowder.  The server described it to us as a creamy potato soup poured over green onions, fried onions, smoked bacon and razor clams.  For a chowder, it was light and very tasty.The cocktails were great - mixed well, flavorful, refreshingWe tried bone marrow for the first time here.  My husband didn't like it and I thought it was over-salted.  It was great that it came with a roasted garlic bulb, but there wasn't anything memorable about it.The duck would have been one of our favorites, but the breast was overcooked.  The duck leg confit was very good, it's too bad the breast wasn't the same.The braised beef rib with the homemade sauce was ok.  The beef was tender but not dry or juicy.  I think the sauce was too overpowering and did not complement the beef at all.The brussel sprouts were good with the cranberries, pecans, and bacon.  That combination worked well.The fries were very thick, steak cut - nothing wrong with that, and it came with a mayonnaise-like dipping sauce.  Not sure what was in that sauce and it didn't do anything for the fries.  We'll stick to ketchup.Dessert:  If you like peanuts and salted caramel with some grape jelly drizzled over it, this is the dessert for you.  We didn't like it one bit.  The chocolate banana s'more, for us, was worse.  The pudding like substance under the toasted marshmallow tasted like nothing we've ever had before.  I'm sure there's someone out there that loves these types of desserts, but we really hated what we ordered.Thankfully, for my birthday, BDT offered us some homemade honey vanilla ice cream.  That was a complete SAVE.  That ice cream is really good!  It's too bad we didn't think the same for their other two desserts.Overall, they should get a 3.5 stars.  The service is good, it's a great place to take a date.  We would return for the cocktails, foie gras, chowder, and honey vanilla ice cream - not sure about anything else.......",Joann B.

Despite not benign able to find an available reservation on OpenTable the week before we went to DC, we were able to make one after we checked into the Park Hyatt. The service was fantastic, and the layout of the restaurant was fascinating, as the open-kitchen layout meant that we were able to watch the kitchen staff hard at work. We ordered two appetizers and two entrees, which were definitely enough for two people. We had the soup of the day, a beautifully done mushroom soup with caramelized onions and the bone marrow, which was served with toasted bread and roasted garlic. Our main courses were the braised beef and the braised lamb shank, both of which were flavorful and done to perfection.

We actually tried to go here for our anniversary back in October but who were we kidding trying to get an rsvp 1 week before, all the time slots (appropriate for dinner time) were all booked up! I mean, who wants to eat dinner at 9:30PM?! Not me! So we decided to save it for another time. I had the honor of celebrating my 30th birthday at BDT!We started off with the bone marrow, it was our first time trying it and we loved it! So soft, buttery, and tasty! We enjoyed it. For entree I had the duck breast and my boyfriend had the hanger steak. We shared a side of the brussels sprouts. Everything was delicious and made with precision and detail. The flavors were unique and something we haven't tasted ever before. I suggest getting at least two side dishes, but one can suffice. For dessert we had mocha custard cake. Couldn't go wrong with anything chocolate/mocha flavored. It was a great ending to the perfect dinner!Service and food were great! I highly recommend coming here!

The crab cakes were great, but I think there are plenty of places in DC to go for a good crab cake. The breakfast buffet was an option, but I just didn't see enough to justify it (not even an omlette/egg station). The restaurant itself is very nice and relaxed.

Reservations are highly recommended. Blue Duck Tavern is truly a 5-star experience, one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. Service was phenomenal and our French server was friendly, knowledgable and very convincing, we followed all of his recommendations. We started with a salad which wasn't just any salad, the dressing was out of this world, it was seriously perfection. Next up was the bone marrow...first time ever trying bone marrow but my husband and I were pleasantly surprised...lots of flavor and when paired with their toast...absolutely amaze! Our main course was steak and mashed potatoes, what can I say, again...perfect! Crab cakes were the best I've ever had...swooning about them as I type! :) All selections were shareable and luckily we ordered just enough; salad, bone marrow, steak and potatoes, bran cakes...stuffed!!!

868,Columbus,2013-01-26,7EmH1ROJAAZ-EJtLYNh2iA,4, OH,"I felt super fancy eating here. Their dinner menu is a little outside my price range, barring special occasions (Barack and Michelle dined here on their anniversary, so I'd feel a little weird having dinner here on any regular day), but it was my turn to pick a brunch spot and I needed a treat.Our group of three had a Saturday reservation for noon and was seated immediately. I carried high expectations for the food and they were met with flying colors. My short rib hash was fantastic. It was so flavorful and must've been wined-braised for 2+ hours because it was definitely falling off the bone tender before they chopped it into pieces for my dish. It came with an oozy sunny side up egg and a scrumptious biscuit on the side. I also tried my friend's bread pudding french toast and wow. I'm not a sweet brunch type of gal, but this was so moist in the middle yet crispy on the outside that I almost stole her food (lucky for our friendship I refrained). The pistachio cranberry garnish, plus fancy maple syrup and whipped topping on the side, made this dish elegant.Unfortunately, the service was mediocre. On one hand, it was over the top, since they do that whole one-handed water pour thing and even brought me a stool to rest my bag on (that was a first). On the other hand, our waitress seemed lost. After we were seated, we waited awhile before she came to take our orders. When we asked for suggestions, she didn't know what to say as if she knew nothing about the dishes. And she never checked on us when we were eating.Overall, I still really enjoyed this restaurant. Ambiance-wise and food-wise, BDT is difficult to exceed. And for only a few bucks more than your average DC brunch place, you can have an exceptional start to your day.",Helen S.

Recently stayed at the Park Hyatt Hotel and was delighted to discover this fine dining restaurant attached.  The service was outstanding, and I can't think of one thing they could do to improve it.  The meal, however, was good but not great.  I had the braised beef rib, which was so dry I couldn't eat it.  Had a much better experience with the sides.  I would return again and again just for the grits with smoked gouda and gravy.  Loved the roasted wild mushrooms, too.  Splurged (carb wise) on the yummy apple pie and ice cream for two... it's just a matter of taste, but I would have liked more apples and less pastry.  However, it didn't stop me from eating over half of the huge portion!  If I lived in DC, I would definitely come back.  (Based on a second awesome meal here, I'm upgrading my rating from four to five quacks.)",Marcia S.

We got the Kale Salad and Braised Beef Rib with a side of BDT Triple Fries and Brussel Sprouts. The chicken that came with my salad and the Beef Rib were both very juicy and flavorful. The Handcut BDT Triple Fries are a must!For drinks, my friend ordered Old Fashioned which he enjoyed very much. What really impressed me was that when I told the server I wanted an alcoholic drink that was blended, which they didn't have on the menu, the manager came over to my table to see what they could specially make for me. They made a fruity, strawberry vodka beverage with very tiny crushed ice so it would have the blended consistency I was looking for and it was delicious!The cherry on top to their amaazing food has to be their staff and service-- very friendly and professional. I 100% recommend this place to anyone that wants a phenomenal dining experience at DC.",Kristine K.

The shared dished, that I am about to tell you to try is a must. It trumps over your breakfast dish I promise. WOOD OVEN-ROASTED BONE MARROW, with a bacon butter, pistachio crust.

879,Seattle,2012-09-17,1Hz0-C7DOm_vT_en-xralA,5, WA,"I had an incredible experience at Blue Duck Tavern yesterday evening. I had been hearing rave reviews about this restaurant from friends for ages, and my meal did not disappoint.BDT is located inside the Park Hyatt hotel. The decor is a rustic and very, very classy. One of my favorite parts of the interior was the open kitchen - you see all of the fine cookery and the chefs at work. It is quite a sight to behold as you dine. Because the weather was nice, my boyfriend and I chose to dine al fresco on the terrace. We were seated by a fountain. Our server, Gina, was extremely friendly, recommending Blue Duck's popular dishes and thoroughly explaining the history of the restaurant. It was some of the best service I have ever received. When I went inside to use the restroom, a server was there to hold the door open for me. Blue Duck has exemplary service, with none of the pretentious air that other high-end restaurants may have. There were customers wearing anything from fancy cocktail dresses and suits to casual jeans and T-shirts. Blue Duck is very versatile.Now, moving onto the food:Bone marrow ($15): A+I have never had bone marrow before. Quite frankly, I'm not a very adventurous eater (liver, organs, etc). The bone marrow here is a must-try. You scoop out the perfectly-seasoned, flavorful inside and spread it atop freshly baked bread. The saltiness of the bone marrow balances perfectly with the bread - I could've eaten so much more of this!Wood oven roasted Maine scallops ($28): A+Plump, juicy scallops with tomato relish, mushrooms, and greens. These were some of the best scallops I've ever had! The accompanying sauce was to die for. Braised beef rib ($25): AThis beef rib is cooked for 32-hours. It falls off the bone just by using a spoon. Yes, my friends, a spoon. For those of you that love fatty, rich beef, this is the dish for you. Potato puree with soft garlic ($9): ASimply the best mashed potatoes you'll ever have - a perfectly smooth, whipped texture. Sauteed spinach ($9): A-Simple greens such as these can be tricky because they're so simple. However, the greens complemented our meal well - they were so fresh, served with spiced pecans and cheese on top. We were also served complimentary bread and fresh veggies in the beginning of our meal, and mini oatmeal raisin muffins at the end. Yes, we finished everything. It was divine. I was so incredibly pleased with Blue Duck last night, and I cannot recommend it enough for a special occasion or a fancy date night. While I consumed a ton of food, I didn't leave feeling bloated or disgusting - the food is just the right amount of savory and flavorful. I can't wait to return!",Anita C.

My date and I are seated in close proximity to three large groups of what look like sorority girls - possibly GW students.

They really want to take care of you. A couple of my favorites include the homemade ricotta and honey, the apple pie (seriously THE BEST APPLE PIE), and the mushrooms. I dream of this place. Ambiance is fantastic and the way the food is plated it is great for sharing. Count me in, double yum.",Cara S.
886,Las Vegas,2010-09-21,9fZDWaKiGN9jkt-RMYC-Ww,3, NV,"After only one visit I'm far from qualified to judge this restaurant as a whole, but I can say that my one dining experience was a big disappointment. First of all, let me just say that the atmosphere is sophisticated, elegant, and modern. It's a beautiful space with an open kitchen, pastry station, and cheese station that makes diners feel like they're intimately involved with every aspect of the food preparation and dining experience. However, whoever designed the space must have gone to the L'Enfant school of architecture and urban planning because the way the place is laid out will confuse any invading gastronomers. I valeted my car and entered the hotel through the main lobby and made my way towards the restaurant. I walked down a hallway and walked right into the pastry station. I was weary of walking through, so I backtracked and tried to make my way through the lounge. There are no clear pathways to the hostess station, so I had to meander through several tables, a large mirrored carousel column, a couple server stations, lounge chairs, and an enclosed glass box that contained some dining tables. I finally found the hostess stand, which was a tiny podium tucked away in a corner. My table wasn't ready so I had to venture back into their maze/lounge to find some place to chill. It really wasn't that big of a deal, but it was a pain in the butt and irritating that the place was laid out so poorly.As for the food... the appetizers were forgettable. The chilled corn soup looked much better than it tasted. The scallops with English peas were bland and gritty. What really annoyed me was the fact that they ran out of a few items on their menu. The sardine app was out, the braised beef rib was out and a couple of the vegetables were out. I was so bummed about not having the braised beef. After reading many other reviews of BDT while I was planning my DC vacation I chose this restaurant specifically to try that dish. I reluctantly ordered the pork dish for my wife and I to split without taking the time to read its description. That was my bad. When it came out we were surprised to see that it was a pork sausage. It did taste good, but the idea of having a sausage as an entree was a big letdown. We also got the polenta and wild mushroom dish, which was tasty.The redeeming quality of my dining experience was dessert. The apple pie was amazing! It's not a slice of pie. It's a whole (4-5 inch diameter) pie! Still, it's large enough for 4 people to share.While dining we noticed the couple next to us was getting ridiculous amounts of food -- some stuff that wasn't on the menu like steak tartare. It turns out they were friends of one of the chefs. By the time their dessert course came around they were begging us to try some of their dishes. We tried the blackberry crumble, pineapple ice cream, and vanilla mascarpone cream. All were amazing and portion sizes were larger than most desserts at fine dining restaurants.So, here's the moral(s) of the story... - Eat at BDT earlier than 9pm so they don't run out of dishes you might want.- Read the descriptions of the dishes. Sounds simple, right? Don't be an idiot like me and order a pork dish thinking it was going to be either a tenderloin or pork chop.- Do a better job of ordering than me. Read the reviews and stick to dishes that get rave reviews like the bone marrow and braised beef.- DC diners are friendly. While eating at Zentan a few nights earlier another table also offered us food. Maybe people think I'm not fat enough and want to feed me? Maybe they're just friendly? Maybe I'm so good looking that people will do anything to get to know me? Who knows... but I'm not turning down free food.",Clint B.
887,Alexandria,2012-07-30,r9hJIgSELN-JtlBSJ5SC_A,5, VA,"Wow, great modern brunch spot. They even made my boyfriend feel like a princess.So we ended up here last weekend for brunch with another couple, and I have to say that it's a really nice spot. The outdoor patio is lovely but the indoor seating with the open air kitchen is really nifty too. Lots of fresh produce and tantalizing baked goods are everywhere you look and yet the place is pristine. Lots of wood and marble and whatnot with a very minimalist and sophisticated vibe.The staff is top notch. They remind me of the ball boys/girls at Wimbledon, so clean cut and attentive in a flash but otherwise unobtrusive. Our server, Meheret, was so polite and anticipated our every need. She even brought a little wooden footstool for my purse to rest on!After reading reviews, I had thought just the grapefruit juice had free refills but it turns out that all the fresh juice is bottomless!

891,Washington,2012-08-11,McP6obifsFk_kNy9ucqWQQ,1, DC,"I came here last Wednesday to celebrate my 4th wedding anniversary and left terribly dissapointed.  First off, we had very high expectation based on all the positive reviews and the fact that the Obamas came here for there wedding anniversary a few years back.  Anyways, the food could be summarized as bland yet overly rich.  We ordered the bone marrow, foie gras terrine, tomato salad, and beef rib.  The bone marrow came out bloody and sinewy and had to be sent back.  It even bled onto the rock salts at the bottom of the dish.  How in the world did they not see that?  They remade the dish and we ate about half of it and called it quits.  The waiter did not as us how it tasted and I think she knew that we did not like the food.  I've had better bone marrow at Queen Vic (and that's a bar on H Street).  It also came out very lukewarm at best.  The foie gras was served in two medallions and had a bland and hard consistency.  My husband described it as thick like a block of cheese when it should have been buttery soft.  The heirloom tomato salad was ok, but nothing specials and the table next to us sent it back because it did not taste good.  The beef rib was probably the only decent dish on the menu but it was not anything special.  We decided to skip on the dessert because we did not want to be further dissapointed.  And also, to top it all off, the pen they gave us to sign our bill was the crustiest old pen I've ever seen.  It has hyatt.com printed on it and half of the words have already been faded off.  I should have gone to Makoto.",Betty L.
892,Reno,2015-01-28,aEUttVotCUSzD7i1B-gJAQ,5, NV,"We were staying a few blocks over at the Embassy Suites and someone recommended coming in to Blue Duck to eat in the lounge area. After a long day with no lunch, we were hungry early so we came in with no reservations around 5 or 5:30 and we able to take a seat in the very comfortable lounge with no problem. You certainly have a great variety of choices on the lounge menu if you choose to go that route - it's not your typical bar fare, and it's not limited at all. There are also some great looking cocktail options. I decided to try the Pomme Pom, which was a great blend of tart fruitiness and alcohol.For my meal, I chose the crab cake - delicious, flaky, and served with an amazing sauce - and also the mixed greens salad, which had that nice bite to it but a good sweet champagne vinaigrette (dressed just right, not too little, not too much). My dining companion had the braised short rib sandwich and said it was absolutely delicious. I would have finished with the apple pie I've seen other mentioned but my companion didn't feel like having dessert and the menu mentioned that it was a portion for two, so I decided to try the brownie with caramel topping. It was not at all what I expected - it was even better. The brownie was actually fairly thin, with the caramel actually more like a rounded mouse layer on top.It's not a cheap meal, even eating in the lounge. With our drinks (I had one cocktail, my companion had two glasses of wine), our tab came out to just over $100. But, we sat in a very comfortable setting on a chilly D.C. evening, didn't rush through our meal, and so for good food, good drinks, and good conversation and a wonderful setting, I think the price is about right.",Chloe G.

895,Rockville,2016-01-13,NbrGyzuoNh4mx6PfWdXKEw,4, MD,"I recently went to the BDT for brunch after hearing it was worth a try. Seating was lovely, as my party had the Lincoln booth.  The restaurant was clean and well appointed with handsome furnishings. The menu for brunch is quite large and several plates sounded delicious. I started with the marrow bones, which I cannot recommend enough. They were beautifully cooked and seasoned. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough toast to spread it on. I also shared an order of the pecan sticky buns which were divine. For my main, I was hoping for the salt fish and potato cake that made the BDT so popular, but that seems to have been taken off the menu long ago. I was pretty sad about it as I was really looking forward to trying it. With so many other great items on the menu, I found something new to try and enjoy, however. The BDT Benedict was rich and fulfilling. Everything was beautifully presented and tasted fresh and well made. My overall experience at the BDT was good, but table service was disappointing. Our waiter took my husbands unused fork and knife away as he was about to use them for the sticky buns. When my husband asked that he leave them as he was about to use them, he mumbled something and walked away hurriedly. He didn't come back for about 5 minutes with more silverware. Also, we never saw our waiter again after receiving our bill. We tried to get change from the bartender nearby, but she didn't have any. If we had been using a credit card to pay for the meal, we would have had to go on walkabout to track our waiter down. I'd go back again, if only to try some new brunch items and get my hands on those marrow bones and sticky buns!",Katy A.

897,Chantilly,2015-04-30,vpAJsekp_pnqD9JAAJUkiQ,5, VA,"***4.5Went here on Monday to celebrate our 6th Anniversary, recommended by one of our friends. I thought it was great. We ordered two apps, two entrees, three sides, and a dessert. For the apps we got the Bone Marrow which was redic. I'd go as far as to say I wouldn't mind swimming in it. We also got the mussels, which was decent, but I think i'm spoiled by the Angry Mussels at Ford's Fish Shack.For our entree's we got the Braised Short Rib, which was very tender and succulent :)  and also the Porchetta which was also awesome.. it is Pork cooked 3 ways. Our waiter Kushma (I think that's his name, was very informative about all the food). For our sides we got the Asparagus with a soft egg, the grits, and the fries. The asparagus was great, as you can crack the soft egg on top and spread the yolk all over. I think there was shreds of parm in there too. He also recommended getting the Grits, which was cooked with smoked gouda and chopped up corn. I think that was probably my favorite thing on the menu, after my first bite my eyes went into the back of my head. One of those dishes that makes you think about all the good things in life. Our third side was the fries.. I wasn't a fan of this actually. I felt that it was too thick, and ate like an entree, instead of a side. Kushma was nice enough to take it off our bill. For dessert, we got the apple pie with vanilla ice cream. This was very tasty. The crust and candied (?) sugar on the top definitely set it off. I wish there was more filling inside tho, not just apples, if that makes sense. The vanilla ice cream was also great!All in all, was definitely worth the trip, and will go back again. Is $14 for a glass of Riesling standard? I don't drink wine that often.",Chris V.

No breading (which I was grateful for) and it was very tender and light. My fiancé had the breakfast sandwich with lamb and an over easy egg. It was ok. Very salty. Biscuits were just a tad...I don't know...dense maybe. I had the prawn baked eggs which were very, very good. I wanted to nap right after I finished, but it was a lovely indulgence.

I appreciate that after telling them that I was there to celebrate they offered rose on the house. Unfortunately, there just weren't any dishes that captivated me. The bone marrow is a good starter, though it was in fact quite salty. The suckling pig and potato puree that everyone on Yelp raved about were well executed. And the crab cakes had so much crab that I can see why it's one of the most popular dishes. The brussel sprouts were fine I mean it's hard to mess up brussel sprouts. But if you want excellent brussel sprouts I suggest the sprouts from Zaytinya given that they're the best I've tried. Ice cream was ok. Jasmine ice cream was definitely a new flavor that I hadn't tried. Also, the three scoops turned out to be a lot bigger than I expected.. Oh and if you choose to get all three use the wooden spoon they give you to soften the ice cream. It actually made it smoother and creamier. All in all, Blue Duck Tavern has good service and the ambiance is nice. But since the flavors were just standard and there weren't any exceptional dishes, I don't think that I'll be going back. Maybe brunch? Who knows :(",Stephanie P.
907,McLean,2014-11-23,D6zwSFUu-usYL_VkqrJkQA,3, VA,"A bit overrated for my taste, or maybe, my expectations were set up too high as this came highly recommended by a few of my friends. The 3 three things I remember fondly are (1) the top-notch service, (2) the bone marrow and (3) the heirloom tomato salad. All other dishes that I ordered were a disappointment.Commentary about Service - My glass of water was always full. Our server provided a great recommendation of pairing something light, fresh, and citrus-y to pair with our order of the bone marrow, which was very rich. The pairing of these two dishes as my first course was stupendous! It complimented each other so well. Commentary about Food - The scallop dish I ordered was disastrous. The scallop was so thinly sliced that it lost all of its texture; it was straight-up mushy. The duck was a bit too salty for my taste. The duck-fat fries were not what I expected. The fries were cut very thickly, which prevented the true indulgence of fries made with duck fat. Each bite didn't have the balance of a nice buttery taste of duck fat with potato.",Michelle T.
908,Washington,2016-12-01,_ZoD1fdv43AlSZ7_IA3Vww,5, DC,"Par excellence. Truly the best restaurant I've ever been too. Everything from the service, to decor, to food was perfect. I had the steak, medium rare, which was perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and incredibly tender. Expensive? Yes. But the best piece of meat I've ever had. I also got the finger cut French fries. They resembled pieces of fried polenta - in the large rectangular form that requires a fork and knife to eat it - in a perfectly cooked, golden color. The flavor was divine. The apple pie was perfection. Service was the best I've experienced in DC ever and the best in general in well over a decade. Decor was immaculate and chic. I'd be privileged to have that meal again.",Sassafras B.

910,Dallas,2015-01-19,EpnP1TQ7l2BXuywnyDRxlw,4, TX,"What a pleasant dining experience.  We arrived for our reservation on time but we had to wait for about 15 minutes at the bar, which was no big deal.  We ordered the parsnip soup, charred kale caesar salad, seared scallops, roasted suckling pig, brussels sprouts and the BDT triple fries.  My personal favorites were the brussels sprouts with ham hock and mustard BBQ, which were the perfect amount of tangy and crispy, and the scallops, which were seared to perfection.  I probably would skip the fries next time - they are very thick cut and fried in duck fat.  They were a good but they serve a huge portion - one fry is enough per person - so they're probably better for a big party.  For dessert we ordered the caramel brownie with tobacco chocolate sauce on the side.  Our waiter suggested getting the sauce on the side because it can be polarizing, ad I'm glad because I didn't care for it but my date did. The service was fantastic.  His name was David and in addition to all we ordered he brought us an extra side dish of roasted wild mushrooms and another dessert with a ginger cookie and a sorbet - both delicious.  I highly recommend coming her to celebrate any special occasions.  :)",Jaime P.

Seriously, a person can get lost here and starve were it not, of course, a restaurant. All kidding aside, the open kitchen is surrounded by several cavernous rooms with plentiful space between tables. It just keeps going, and going, and going...Our server led us to the spectacular wagyu beef and the lovely suckling pig. We also had the oven-roasted bone marrow and the wild mushrooms, both of which were spectacular. Although I was not particularly impressed by the recommended cakey dessert, we washed our meal down with after-dinner drinks and mentally voted: Blue Duck Tavern was spot-on and is definitely a place to which to return.",Kristina K.

We opted for a chefs table where we sat next to the kitchen but being a foody I prefer this to a window table with so much to look at. The Charcuterie and cheese plate is always my-go-to and here it will impress. The hanger steak was great but I'm willing to bet nothing disappoints here. If you even think about dessert you-must get the apple pie and homemade ice cream(flavors vary). Also if you'd like a nice cocktail go sit at the bar and get the bartender to make you a drink.

Nothing too extreme, just okay.  I'm very confused by the wow factor here. trying not to take away from the fresh food.

I've never had brussel sprouts before and was always told that they're good, but only if they're made right. This was definitely made right. The dressing was nice and light but still had really good flavor. Delicious. We also ordered the bone marrow, the 12 hour roasted suckling pig, and the roasted Muscovy duck. Bone marrow is one of my favorite dishes and it was made wonderfully here. Both the duck and the suckling pig were also delicious. They both had crispy skins on them that were so full of flavor and the sauces worked really well with both meats...Yum.We were so full that we didn't order dessert but for sure next time I definitely want to order one of their sweets.

922,New York,2012-04-10,ji5dtdj-eKb1nPZqhadBag,5, NY,"Blue Duck Tavern is a gorgeous, spacious, and classy restaurant located in the Park Hyatt hotel in an upscale neighborhood of Washington DC.BDT's biggest differentiator is their open kitchen, and lucky us, we were plopped right in front of it! My boyfriend is a huge Food Network fanatic, and he definitely enjoyed watching the chefs working their magic. The open kitchen allowed us to observe the love and dedication that is poured into their cooking! When you make reservations, make sure to ask if you can be seated near there.We started off with some sourdough bread, which was carried to us from the bread table where they were freshly cutting it to order. We then ordered the Braised Beef Rib ($25), the Muscovy Duck Breast ($28), and a side of sautéed wild mushrooms ($12). I love that the menu paid respects to the origins of the dishes' ingredients. The dishes came out rather quickly, and were served in small metal pans; very sleek presentation.Everything was delicious. Although we got mostly meat, I didn't feel as if the meal was too heavy. There were several different varieties of wild mushrooms in our side dish, and the olive oil croutons added a nice and unexpected crunch to each bite. The Braised Beef Rib came out with the bone and 3 pieces of meat, already cut for us. Each bite was simply divine. The Muscovy Duck Breast came out looking like a masterpiece - almost too pretty to eat! Perfectly crispy skin, next to a thin layer of duck fat followed by the slightest pink duck meat, topped off with sweet kumquat marmalade. I have absolutely no complaints about this wonderful meal!Sans drinks, a meal for 2 topped off just around $80. Definitely not an everyday dinner place, but Blue Duck Tavern is a fantastic restaurant to go for a special night out on the town.

Normally I'm pretty harsh on restaurants, especially those of the fine dining ilk, but I'm giving it 5 stars because the whole experience was flawless. Ambience - dark, romantic, and modern. Chic and simple,  with hardwood floors and wood accents throughout. Servers wear a sports jacket over a buttoned dress shirt, but with no tie and a loose collar creates a casual and relaxed vibe. We sat near the open kitchen which was awesome as we got to see the chef in action. Food- top notch. Started with mussels and foie gras. Both perfectly seasoned and cooked correctly. Foie was a touch ""veiny"" but not enough to generate a legitimate complaint. Entrees were rabbit tagliatelle and fried quail. Sides were mushrooms and their famous steak cut fries. Both dishes were amazing. Execution again was perfect and flavors were on point. Quail had a touch a sweetness from being glazed with honey. Desert was apple pie for two. Literally a mini whole apple pie. Thoroughly enjoyed. Service- excellent. Wayne really took care of us. It was my birthday and my gf and I were greeted with 2 glasses of complimentary bubbly. Gf has a severe dairy allergy and they did a great job accommodating her dietary restriction while keeping it casual and nonchalant. Meaning, our server had the confidence and knowledge of the menu to quickly refer to what she could or couldn't have without having to consult with the chef first. That impressed us. When we left, I mentioned in the car that the only thing I could say wasn't perfect was the fries - they were just slightly on the well done side. That's not even a complaint- there's nothing wrong with crispy well done fries!! That's how good this meal was. Seriously, Blue Duck, you killed it.",Silvio L.

Adjoining the exquisite Park Hyatt hotel on 24th Street in the West End, it creates a serious culinary atmosphere with its open kitchen while somehow retaining the sophistication and serenity of a high-end hotel dining room. Service and ambiance show no signs of stuffiness. Lovely place to bring a date, out of town guests, clients, or parents.ROASTED BONE MARROW ($14) was creative and delectably decadent with a parsley pesto of some kind and roasted garlic. I felt it needed a touch more salt instead of merely being served on a bed of rock salt.  CRAB CAKE ($16), with a side of frisée, was the best jumbo lump crab cake I've had on the east coast. It was more delicate with less filler than your average Baltimore variety, pan fried until slightly crispy on the bottom and broiled until lightly brown on top. If only it would've been bigger (I dream), it would be just about the perfect specimen!SPINACH TART ($11) was like a wedge of quiche served at room temperature. It was rich yet light. We also ordered the day's ""market vegetable"" side of CREAMED CORN ($9). The kernels were cooked just right: you can tell they're from fresh corn, not canned, and the bacon's smokiness perfumed the entire dish.Of course, all of this wonderfulness comes at a fairly steep price -- a high disclaimer indeed.

We weren't exactly sure where the restaurant was, so we asked a gentleman at the hotel front desk. I expected him to simply point to where we should go, but instead, he not only guided us to the restaurant, but also gave us a tour of the open kitchen, dining, and bar area. Then he proceeds to check us in through the reservation desk. I already knew the rest of our dining experience was going to be top notch, judging from the initial level of customer service. We ordered 3 cocktails, and my first cocktail had a fruit fly in it, but the server took it back, apologized, and comped it. Even that incident did not make me take a star off this review. For appetizers, we ordered the bone marrow, which had a really cool presentation, and seasoned to perfection. We also got the salmon, which was really fresh and melts in your mouth. Our favorite dish of the night was the chicken-fried quail. It was so crispy and flavorful, sweetness with just the right amount of heat. (Reminded me a little bit of Thai chili sauce.) We took a chance on a dish that we typically would not order, and it completely paid off. To top it off, we had their famous apple pie for dessert. It came with 3 large scoops of ice cream. Enough said. The service throughout the night was excellent. Our server was very knowledgeable and attentive. I could not have asked for a better dining experience on my birthday.

930,Washington,2012-03-14,2eEb7dTWiR-io6n9gREeXw,4, DC,"The Blue Duck Tavern was one of my more memorable meals.  This is good because I had really wanted to eat here and it was a (mostly) wonderful experience.Between the two of us, we had the duck breast, braised ribs, fries, and chocolate cake.  We also each had a wine - a viognier for me and a pinot noir for him and enjoyed both.  The bread was delicious and the butter was one of the richest butters I've tasted.  The Muscovy duck breast with duck leg ragout and kumquat marmalade was delicious.  Normally, I find the typical orange marmalade/duck pairing too sweet, but since the kumquat marmalade was a bit sour, it worked well.  The duck breast, cooked medium, had perfectly crisp skin over a layer of fat.  The duck leg ragout was flavorful.  However, the braised ribs were amazingly tender and tasty.  While the duck was great, the ribs outdid the duck.  Blue Duck is famous for their fries, and they did not disappoint - big, crisp, and tasty.  Dessert was amazing.  While chocolate lava cake may sound trite, the one at Blue Duck is so worth it.  It was the best one I've had, super rich, with cherries and fresh cream on the side.  I'd go back just for dessert.Service was great, with the main server and her assistant being friendly and professional.  Hostess told us we could not sit outside, though the patio was mostly empty, but groups that came after us were seated outside.  Also, a group that came after us without reservations (we had reservations) was seated before we were.  Those two issues did not exactly thrill me.  As with many restaurants, it is extremely loud and seating is quite close, so if you want a quiet, intimate meal, this is not the place.  But the food is great, so definitely put it on your list.",Lia M.

The space is modern and elegant, but completely unpretentious, and the service is friendly and incredibly attentive without ever making diners feel rushed (our reservation was at 8pm and we left at 11:15pm, and our waiter made us feel like we could sit there all night if we wanted). The pacing of the meal is absolutely impeccable, and with the exception of the very overpriced cocktails, Blue Duck Tavern is, at least in my mind, very reasonably priced for what it is. The entrees are served in small skillets which I thought was absolutely lovely because it encourages sharing - we ordered the roasted swordfish (served with eggplant puree, chickpeas and oregano), the oven roasted chicken (heavenly),  the braised beef rib, and the absolutely divine crab cakes (I'll just say the Washingtonian Review is wrong - the crab cakes are righteous!).  And then we split three sides  - the collard greens (yes, yes, yes! Note to veggie folks -- the collard greens have bacon), the mixed mushrooms, and the daily vegetable (which was glazed carrots).  4 entrees and 3 sides was absolutely plenty for four diners (we skipped appetizers) and I love that the service of the food encouraged us to share, and to sample all of the dishes.As everyone says, dessert just shouldn't be missed. The chocolate cake is absolutely decadent; even something as simple as the strawberry sorbet tastes like pure goodness, as did the maple pecan tart served with a scoop of honey vanilla ice cream.The only miss of the evening was the bread basket - the bread was just a bit too rough for my taste.  But I'll forgive that considering this was an incredible, amazing, divine, special meal.",Jennifer N.

Even though it didn't seem like a lot it was very filling. I also had their market desert which was a blueberry lime tart with blueberry sauce.

938,Muncie,2015-09-20,bVY4y_YWqTlJceDg3Mh0zQ,5, IN,"In town for a business meeting, my group had dinner at the Blue Duck on a Friday night. We had a private table inside, toward the back of the restaurant, which in some places is a recipe for neglect. Not this night. Our server was on point and attentive all evening. The space is beautiful, even showcasing what appeared to be vintage quilts hanging in a very modern space.Our party of seven had quail, pork chops, shrimp, and chicken among the entrees. The quail, glazed with pepper jam, was deemed the best my colleague had ever had. The pork chops came sliced, ready for sharing, if so desired. I did not try them, but they were also deemed delicious by those who ordered them, clearly moist and perfectly presented. I had the pan seared shrimp, with okra and watermelon (yes, watermelon!) in a corn puree. Let's just say I offered to share, but not loudly enough for anyone to really hear me. The shrimp were small, so initially I was concerned about the portion size. However, the dish was truly perfectly prepared, with a flavor palate that was complex and well matched. And, yes, there was enough for it to be filling! Sides are extra, and expected to be shared (I would say they would each serve two). The grits with smoked gouda and red-eye gravy was a creamy treasure. The bulgar wheat with pistachios and the fried cauliflower sides were also amazing. It would be very easy to just order three sides and be happy with one's meal.Then were was dessert - most of which were also designed to serve two. I tasted the peach buckle, which simply melted in the mouth in its warm and creamy goodness. My own order, the night's desert special, was a mixed berry slab pie with a small scoop of ice cream. It was rich, buttery, perfectly made, and tasted as though the berries had been picked that very morning. I would order it again in a heartbeat. Although none of us had it that night, the apple pie also looked pretty as a picture; the colleagues who chose the restaurant indicated that it had been a favorite from one of their previous visits. The meal ended with what I believe were housemade marshmallows with a chocolate glaze - I was not privy to the description, but the flavor seemed to be smoky, dark chocolate and toasty marshmallow. The combination was quite intense; it was not a flavor that I personally cared for, but I could definitely appreciate the skill that went into crafting it.The Blue Duck is not a restaurant for the faint of heart (or wallet). It is the place to take someone you want to impress, and/or someone who is a food lover. It was worth every penny; I am just glad I was not paying the bill",Sharon B.

He offered suggestions when the wine we wanted wasn't available, he was attentive, and was just great. The food was amazing. We started with steak tartare, which I loved. I wanted to try the bone marrow (never had it before!) but my husband wasn't feeling adventurous. For main dishes, I had the lamb shank and my husband got the steak. My lamb was great, but I liked my husband's steak more. We got the polenta and hand cut fries as sides. Polenta was amazing - creamy and delicious. Hand cut fries we so-so. I think we could've done without them. We had the chocolate ice cream and caramel pretzel for dessert. Both were SO GOOD and really a highlight of the night even though I'm not a dessert person. All in all, I had a great time and am glad we chose this place to celebrate our first year together. Would definitely love to return!",Ally D.

942,Bethesda,2015-06-24,LUH0WNFSzAQJA2WOv9oHpQ,5, MD,"This is one of my favorite places to eat in DC! Everything I've ever ordered has always been savory! Unfortunately I just recently started reviewing on yelp and taking pictures but last time we were dining here at the chefs table and it was simply delicious. Every surprise dish was perfect. This time we just ordered a few items off the menu and my favorite is the suckling pig... And let me tell you, that pig really was suckling. My mouth watered extra at the first bite. It's got also a crispy pork skin as well. I wish I could have five orders at a time... The swordfish was also very good. It was flavorful and light at the same time as you would want fish to be cooked. The steak was good but what was interesting was the weird green spiral vegetables which I found out is called fiddleheads. I've never seen these things before and it has become my top favorite veggie to eat. I want it on all my dishes! (I go through extreme binging of foods I get obsessed with periodically). Blue duck tavern is a must try restaurant! You can close your eyes and point and it will be delicious. Go for it!!",Diana J.
943,Milwaukee,2014-03-13,FspJCAwccicNsUjKIi7oBw,2, WI,"I went here back in July while in DC for a convention. I had seen the national coverage and read a couple of local reviews about how great their brunch experience was. Hey, I'm a brunch dude, sign me up! So, I went in with a ton of excitement and anticipation of great meal and dining experience. Yeah, I wish I could split this review into two separate ratings...Food:Almost everything my group had was phenomenal. The duck fat fries and apple pie are particularly worth noting. It was all very fresh and flavorful. Two in the group had mimosas and said they were spot on as well. Another had strawberry waffles, another hit. I had the frittata, (seafood, spinach, it was a while ago... ) it was great.Service:Horrendous doesn't accurately describe what we dealt with. Inept, slow, inattentive,  overwhelmed are all adjectives that describe the server we had. She was really awful. The manager that came over was really nice and took care of us personally for the rest of our meal but that server. After she was reprimanded she forget to give us our bill. After a twenty minute wait I had to go and get it from her.Overall, the best way to describe this experience is that it was unfortunate. I don't believe in slamming a place - everyone has a bad day. And looking at all of the glowing reviews, I feel safe in assuming that we caught the wait staff on a particularly awful one. But, factoring in that we were on vacation, celebrating a birthday, and were really excited to dine here...I wish we could have caught them when they were on their A game. Based on what we dealt with, I can't recommend.",Brandon C.

So call in advance or go to OpenTable and make.a.reservation.I've had my eye on this spot for quite some time but never had the chance to dine here until recently when my sister had generously taken the family here for our birthday dinner. What a great choice. This place was definitely up to par. The service was impeccable and the food was just absolutely amazing. I was more than pleased with the service from the moment we stepped foot in the building ( this restaurant is located in the Hyatt Hotel). We were greeted with friendly smiles and seated immediately. Our server was very kind and informative about the daily specials and what was offered on the menu. He gave great suggestions and was extremely attentive. We ordered the Bone Marrow appetizer and it was so good! Way better than the Bone Marrow I tried at the Purple Pig in Chicago. They paired it with a few slices of toast to spread the marrow over and it was just perfect. My sister and brother both ordered the 12-hour suckling pig and it was divineeeeee. The crispy pig skin was just delectable. The pork fell apart once your fork pierced it. So tender. I had the tile fish encrusted with a mustard base with a side of more bone marrow. My dish was good but nothing compared to the pistachio encrusted bass at Bistro Cacao. However, the fish was cooked perfectly and the bone marrow went well with it as well as the bok choy. My mother ordered the  braised beef rib and that was really good too! Tender and not over seasoned.Dessert---- We ordered their famous apple pie, vanilla ice cream and the raspberry panna-cotta. ALL of which was SO YUMMY!!!! I was more focused on the panna-cotta. It was soooooo creamy and smooth. It was the lighter dessert out of the three but definitely not light in flavor. It was amazing.The restaurant itself was very nice and clean. We were seated by the open kitchen layout they had. The ambiance was inviting and warm yet sophisticated and modern. I loved the place so much I made my boyfriend take me the following weekend for my actual birthday. He LOVED it. Definitely will be back to try their brunch menu.",Christina N.

950,Washington,2014-06-16,UV7HuRvwE_2-HWR2d9gsxw,4, DC,"We came here on a Friday evening and had a fantastic time. I've been to Blue Duck Tavern several times over the past few years and have never been disappointed. Great drinks, better food, and fantastic service. Sure, this place isn't cheap, but it's a fantastic getaway in one of my favorite parts of the city - the West End.Something to note -- this place is definitely better if you're ordering family style. The portions were slightly too much for me (which isn't bad, because I got to eat it for lunch the next day), but in terms of enjoyment, variety, and value, it's a lot more fun to order 5 or 6 things between 4 or 5 people.  My partner and I had a starter and entree, each, along with two sides. It was absolutely too much.That said, the chilled tomato soup was delicious. Heavy, but delicious. Same goes for the mashed potatoes. We ate one a few bites, took the rest home, and when we pulled it out of the fridge, it was a box of congealed butter with some potatoes. Never ask to see how the sausage is made...or how much butter goes in the mashed potatoes. Still, probably some of the best I've ever had.Raspberry sorbet was a tad bitter for me, and the cantaloupe sorbet was tad sweet.  I think the kitchen went slightly heavy with the salt on our latest visit, but I'm certain that's an aberration.  My only nit to pick for BDT was the front of the house. Half-hearted welcome, no good-bye. Someone get those guys some coffee (which, by the way, was delicious).",Shamik T.

We were attending a performance at the Kennedy Center, and so we had an early reservation at 5:30pm. We considered our night out to be a special occasion, but Blue Duck Tavern simply did not live up to our expectations. Given the price tag, I'd look elsewhere for that wow factor.When we arrived, even though the restaurant was empty, we still had to wait close to 10 minutes for our seats. The host then proceeded to take us to (arguably) the worst seats in the restaurant -- a dimly lit, tiny table right by the kitchen and service station. Given that we had a reservation (and the restaurant was empty!), not quite sure why the host chose to make such a bad impression on us! We then asked if we could move by the window, and they obliged.Throughout the meal, our server was straightforward and efficient. Nothing memorable or special, but she provided good service.As for the food, we ordered a salad, harvest vegetables, and the suckling pig and duck entrees (with a few glasses of wine). Having eaten at many top restaurants in the DC area, I was really underwhelmed. My duck entree was quite a bit of inedible fat and the suckling pig was just okay. I've had higher quality food at much lower prices with better service at other places.Do yourself a favor and celebrate that special night somewhere else!",Hannah B.

955,Rockville,2012-01-31,EXGfGlBJYeYPhrcPd8NF0g,4, MD,"This ain't your local, the boozer down the block, this isn't a tavern. That all said and done. This is a luxurious restaurant. The term, 'tavern' is more of misnomer here or at its best, false advertising. There isn't the typical dark woods, bad lighting, pool table, pictures of famous Irish/Scottish writers, but there will probably be a dart board in the back with my picture on it. It's actually the hotel's restaurant, but as far as I'm concerned, it's the tavern elevated. There's the main dining room and by the bar encased in glass there are private rooms...the only problem is is that you feel that you're watching humans in cages. Ok, it's an elevated restaurant and zoo exhibit at the same time. I really want to crack a joke like it's feeding time at the Blue Duck Tavern and the ducks are sitting in their human blind using their human call, shouting out, 'Free Gin, Free Bordeaux, Free Brie!"" The worst part is that it works. I heard the call and made my way to the bar and ordered the oven roasted bone marrow and the hand cut BDT (the secret is the duck fat) triple fries.* *Disclaimer: Eating these two together may be your step towards future heart issues. I'm not a cardiologist, I just see one in real life. The bone marrow comes out on a bed of sea salt with bones sliced in half. It is served with bread, spiced pumpkin butter and the tour de force, the roasted garlic. The bone is roasted ever so elegantly with marrow (that wonderful tinty hemoglobin) and fat cooked just right so it isn't burned, but allowed to melt together in it's own juices creating a gravey like effect. Bearing in mind that bone marrow was indigenous to our earliest ancestors. So, yes, it's cave man food, albeit elevated cave man food. So, here was my plan of attack:Take the breadSmear several roasted cloves of garlic on the breadSmear the pumpkin butterThen apply the marrow of one bone. Add a little cracked pepper. Go to town like no one's business. The roasted garlic caramelized so perfectly just coalesces with the butter and marrow. It is the perfect symphony. Inevitably, you will leave some of the marrow in the bone. This is when you grab the wonderful duck fat fried fries and use it like a sponge to clean up the marrow out of the bone. This may be one the most decadent dishes that i've ever eaten and probably one of my favorite meals on the planet.  This is a Tavern, this is 'The' Tavern of taste. I'm coming back for more. I'm just glad that the College of Cardiology is down the block. It's true...Google it.",Trevor M.
956,Bethesda,2014-05-04,3ereyNgXee5y-bYvM5w5IA,3, MD,"Typically over-praised, disappointing example of high-end DC dining.The service was very strange. Our server was pleasant and very knowledgeable about the menu, but had to be asked to take our drink order - after we'd been sitting with menus for 30 minutes. The first courses came out 55 minutes after we were seated (though, in BDT's favor, when the one hot starter was running later than the three salads, they brought a complimentary consolation dish to tide one diner over). Timing for the rest of the meal was appropriate, though I don't think anyone was offered a coffee refill, and we weren't there at closing time.The wine list is ridiculous. Every varietal/region category is sorted by /price/, rather than characteristics of the wine, or vintage, which suggests either a misunderstanding of how people choose wine, or knowledge of the evil in the hearts of the people who dine there. Even worse, I think, there was one category for ""Syrah and Petit Sirah,"" which seems like a grouping no one who gives a crap about wine would make. A couple of the dishes were excellent - all the other Yelpers praising the bone marrow are right to do so - and nothing was bad, and the prices are fair for mid-to-high-end dining. The choice to serve all of the main courses in pans to the side of the plate is odd, and leads to a crowded table, though it does facilitate sharing - but doesn't everyone feel comfortable passing bites now? And it eventually becomes tiresome, if you're actually eating what you ordered, to transfer everything to your plate yourself, then try to move some pan sauce over, without spilling it anywhere. The style would make more sense if several of the proteins were sized for sharing, but hardly any are.The cocktails are well-conceived and the few we had were perfectly made.Surely the only restaurant in America with coat hooks on the wall /and/ little stools for purses.",Scott S.

Nothing about this place screams ""hotel bar"". I had a wonderful cocktail and we shared a plate of cheeses and cured beef (bresaola) and some huge duck fat fries. Really nice beer, wine, and cocktail list, and very good service. There are multiple small bar areas throughout and one person hand slices the meats and cheeses in the dining room. Decor is approachable and seating options are diverse: from club chairs around a low table to bar stools clustered around big communal tables to large glass-encased booths. We went on a weeknight and had no trouble getting in without a reservation. YOU MUST GET the DUCK FAT FRIES. A potato seems to make about 4-5 fries and they are just spectacular.

Only caveats: I've been here a few times where they have gone 20 - 30 minutes past my reservation time without so much as an apology, and the tables are VERY close to one another.

It was a rare night to ourselves for us, so we wanted to have a good meal. Without doing a whole lot of research, I navigated us to Blue Duck Tavern, not a long walk from our hotel. We were wary at first-- ""high-end"" on Maui versus ""high-end"" on the mainland is quite different, so we weren't sure if we would fit in. After a somewhat cold greeting from the hostesses, we were even more worried. However, after being greeted by our server, Zach, we were put at ease. He gave us an overview of the menu, and took our cocktail orders. They were both delicious! We started with the charcuterie board, and scraped up every last morsel on it. I never knew I'd be daydreaming weeks afterward about chicken liver mousse. Our entrees were equally delicious, and Zach had no problem pairing them with perfect wine choices. I had the wagyu beef, and my husband had the suckling pig. We ordered the duck fat fries as a side, and everything was perfect. To finish off, we chose a simple scoop of jasmine ice cream and some espressos. It was totally a five-star meal. We felt very welcome and at home while dining, and look forward to returning the next time we're in DC.

966,Nashville,2014-05-02,ihESFHokCEJaHUEu9aMxzQ,4, TN,"Overall there was nothing I could imagine complaining about. The space is absolutely beautiful, the staff was attentive and super accommodating (I am allergic to gluten), and the food was good. We had the bone marrow, suckling pig, duck breast+duck confit, BDT Fries,  and grits. The bone marrow was as expected, divine. The suckling pig was delicious and porky in the best way possible. It tasted like a beautifully swiney cut of natural pork you would have outside of the US, where all the flavor and fat is not bred out of the pigs. Also to cheese bowl they called grits was really delicious and surprisingly complex. I am assuming multiple cheeses were used  since the grits had a surprising depth of flavor. On not impressed side were the duck and BDT fries. The duck breast was on the raw side for my taste and the skin was still a bit too thick and fatty. It could have used a better sear and maybe some salt. But the confit drumstick definitely helped out by adding some amazingly tender and flavorful meat to the dish. As for the fries, I get as sexually aroused as the next person at the mention of something being fried in duck fat, but the fries just did not work for me. First off, it's hard to beat regular fries, but the triple fry process left the fries just tasting like a surprisingly bland and dry log of fatty starch. To end on a positive note I also tried some kind of a fruit cocktail that was so good, it almost made me think that there is a place in the world for a $15 dollar drink...............almost. Overall, great experience, but I am a cheap date and would much rather try 4 different restaurants for the price of one visit to BDT. But if you are a baller and appreciate the classy experiences more than I do, you should definitely check it out.",Jasmin S.
967,Sterling,2013-12-25,UQlasU5cSWIJx_27SlqyvQ,4, VA,"4.5 stars. Phenomenal little restaurant. Who would have known it would be located inside of the Hyatt??This restaurant offers beautiful decor, friendly and welcoming staff, and amazing food that melts in your mouth and then explodes into a million different flavors that will dance on your tongue and leave you with an unforgettable experience.We chose this place for our xmas eve dinner, and decided to order what the restaurant was best known for since it was our first time, as well as a few other delicious treats.Roasted Muscovy Duck Breast, crispy leg confit, squash relish: The two words that best describe the duck breast are SUCCULENT & JUICY. The duck breast came out already sliced into 6 pieces and soaked in a delicious sauce. The crispy leg confit was also a perfectly light crisp with a warm tender center. Easily the best $29 I've spent on a meal all year.Braised Beef Rib in homemade steak sauce: I was a bit confused when this one came out because although it was definitely of a ""fall of the bone"" consistency, but the bone was missing. Regardless, the beef was very soft and tender, and the sauce it came with was very rich. Not as good as the duck, but still a good entree, however not completely worth the $27.Oysters on the half shell: I swear the freshness of these oysters made it more of an aphrodisiac than usual. These oysters were the cleanest, freshest raw oysters I've ever had the pleasure of slurping. The vinegar sauce it came with was also a perfect compliment.Vegetable of the day - Brown Butter Roasted Sweet potatoes, marshmallow, sage, vanilla: I absolutely love sweet potatoes, as it is one of my most favorite parts of the holiday season. However, I have never had sweet potatoes as delectable as these. The flavors in this side will truly explode in your mouth and leave you in awe. The mix of flavors was absolutely perfect, and the surprise caramelized pecans at the bottom of the dish added the perfect crunch.All in all I had a great experience here.

970,Washington,2015-01-24,wHs1WocMe6SU-62hI3mriQ,5, DC,"Excellent place. Usually, when people think a restaurant in a hotel they go ""ehhhh.."" This is one of those unusual exceptions that proves people's opinions wrong.The place looks amazing, though slightly hard to navigate (you kinda have to go through a dining area to get to the main desk). A very open kitchen so you can see the chefs rushing about. Atmosphere is probably idea for a date.I had the fish of the day (I regret not being able to get a picture or the details), but I enjoyed every second of it.This place is phenomenal. Now I see why it's a favorite of the political class (a favorite date night place for the Obamas, eatery for Rupert Murdoch, etc.).UPDATE: Apparently it is well-known for its memorable Thanksgiving feasts. It also hosts breakfasts with jumbo lump crab on eggs and gluten-free pastries for everyone.",Carlos R.

973,Alexandria,2015-05-02,ZmkO4KWolWF2AipCHfAl9w,5, VA,"Amazing experience! I would highly recommend this place based on the experience alone; food was good but not nearly as memorable as the ambiance and outstanding service. We went for a late dinner and were seated in the dining room, facing the open kitchen. Our server, David G, was on point with everything--from recommending wines and describing appetizers and specials, to ever-so-gently steering us away from the fries (informing us one order was more than enough for a party of 8!!). We had originally planned to enjoy dinner here and move elsewhere for dessert and drinks, but David managed to keep us until closing, without us even realizing how the time had passed. We were having such a wonderful time; the wine was flowing and David surprised us with an order of fries for dessert! He insisted we try it just because we had been talking about it throughout our meal. He was certainly right about the portion size. It was huge! To top off our memorable experience, David gave us  a tour of the kitchen, including the pastry station (where stacks of their famous mouthwatering apple pies were sitting, just waiting to be ordered) and introduced us to the chef! We couldn't have chosen a better spot for date night. Thanks David G!",Sunny B.

While waiting for our table we sat at the bar and enjoyed a bottle of Ponzi Pinot Noir. The bar was interesting with glass walls and such and service was great.For dinner we got the bone marrow, braised beef, duck, and for sides the creamed corn and spinach. All were very good. I noticed that the beef was on the bone in yelp pics but ours was not and maybe that's why it wasnt as tender as I was expecting but the sauce was very good. My boyfriend LOVED the duck and made orgasmic noises with each bite. Personally I don't really like duck but have to admit it was tender and the skin was crispy. The creamed corn was very very good!For dessert we were surprised w a complimentary lemon meringue dessert w ice cream and they brought it out w a candle. Boyfriend ate every single bite.Overall, the best birthday dinner I could have asked for. Service was great, food was great!

977,Alexandria,2014-01-27,EvYCXi9-ehT2yQoEemAn_g,4, VA,"**I'm updating my review to dock it a star. My boyfriend's mother informed us a few days ago that upon getting home, they realized that a 20% gratuity had been included in the bill. Unfortunately, it wasn't well-marked (and it wasn't mentioned on the menu), so his father tipped ANOTHER 20% or so on top of that amount. With a bill that high, we are talking around another $200. I'm sure he would've added something additional, but not another 20%. I think it should have been very evident on the menu or at least on the bill, so I'm reducing their stars.**I was fortunate to be invited to my boyfriend's birthday dinner with several of his family members this past weekend. I had always heard fantastic things about Blue Duck, but even so, it surpassed my expectations.Our server had recommended an appetizer and main dish for each person, along with 5 sides for 7 diners. I think we could easily have eliminated one of the sides, and probably gotten an entree less, and everyone would have been satiated. The family style servings are not enormous, but certainly large enough for each of our group of seven to have a taste. For my own starter, I had the baby kale salad, which I thought was excellent but my boyfriend declared too heavily dressed. He ordered steak tartare, and though I liked it, I managed to get a bite that was mostly the potato accompaniment, which sort-of flattened the flavor of the beef itself. I didn't end up trying it, but the oven-roasted bone marrow was apparently fantastic (and HUGE--you could easily have it as an entree). It seemed like the mains were designed to share, as most of the meats were pre-sliced and served with tongs, so easy to share (if the orderer chose to)! For my entree, I had the fish special, which was skatewing with a scallop puree. It was lovely, but I think that the meat dishes were more memorable. My boyfriend's suckling pig was absolutely delicious and served over perfectly roasted root vegetables (I loved the parsnips). I also really enjoyed the duck breast and venison--both were perfectly executed. I didn't end up trying the Wagyu Teres Major (he wasn't sharing, ha!), but it was declared wonderful. And the diner who ordered the crab cakes said they were the best that she had ever had before (there seemed to be no binder), and she lives in Annapolis and eats them often.  For our sides, we ordered the Creamy Stone-Ground Grits with Smoked Gouda, the Crispy Brussels Sprouts, Roasted Wild Mushrooms, and two orders of the hand-cut triple fries. We certainly did not need the second order of fries, and probably could have eliminated another side. I thought the only less-than-memorable pick was the mushrooms, but the Brussels sprouts were far and away the standout choice.We were so full that no one really wanted dessert, and the birthday boy doesn't have much of a sweet tooth. So we were served a dish of sorbet with a candle, along with a cake pop for each guest. They were the perfect way to end the meal. It's a bit strange to me that you walk THROUGH the pastry-making section of the kitchen to get to the restaurant itself, but it definitely made me happy that we were able to have a small sample since you're tempted by them on your way in and out. We let the oenophile in the group choose the wines and they were excellent, but I suspect that their price point demanded it.The decor is understated, but elegant. It's airy and light and glass-filled inside, and we had a wonderful round table situated near the middle of the restaurant. Our service was excellent--attentive, but not at all pushy.My only complaints are that we ended up with an early time slot (6:15 was the only one available) even when making reservations well in advance, and the largest table we could book (even putting a card down) was for 8. I also disliked having to walk through the kitchen to get to the restaurant--I'd rather there at least be a pane of glass there or something to divide passersby from your potential dessert. The concept is good (the open kitchen), but I really felt a little germophobic thinking about the possibility of someone sneezing or what-have-you as they walked through! The bar (which should be reviewed separately) had an extremely awkward layout that seemed to have been created with the same sort of plan in mind, but to me, it just didn't work.",Meredith D.

We ordered the blue duck tavern fries and the grits. They were both absolutely delicious!!!  The reason for the 3.5 is because their entrees were a little mediocre. We ordered the duck and the short rib. Both were good but neither were unique nor spectacular. Overall I would probably come back when in town just for the fries!  Must order the fries!,Pam T.

We were seated at one of the window tables along the partially secluded outside patio, which was still rife with flowers and plants. Our neighboring diners all seemed a bit... uptight, which naturally provided for some really hilarious people-watching.We started with some breakfast cocktails (two thumbs up for the Chesapeake BM) and the house-baked croissants. The buttery, flaky folds were delightful on their own but otherworldly when eaten with dollops of pear butter, blueberry preserves and whipped ricotta, all served alongside. I attempted to save as much room as possible for my main course, but the casserole dish of short rib hash topped with an olive oil poached egg and a dense biscuit was far too rich to be tackled completely. The horseradish cream that came alongside was ridiculous. And speaking of which, we also ordered a side of duck fat fries, which came piping hot in a metal cup with a side of garlic aioli for dipping. It came as no surprise that even my boots were tight the day after this indulgence, but the price I'll pay at the gym all week is well worth the splurge. Also, it should be said that service was excellent, if just a touch slow towards the end of our meal when we were ready to run out and unbutton that top button.

If you've been here and did not enjoy the experience, I would give them another shot. I usually don't like to give bad experience another chance, but my first time experience here is just that great. First, everything was placed nicely on the table. After looking through a dictionary thick of drink menu, we finally just ordered something or ask for a recommendation. The complementary bread and butter came right away. Right before the second round of the bread, the appetizer came along. I had the lobster salad and it was good. My friend got the lobster bisque. It just depends what you like more, I should have mixed the salad a little bit more for the dressing to be mixed evenly. If you like something a little bit more heavy, the lobster bisque is amazing. They probably have lobster's shell to have that much flavor in there. It was not too creamy and it has a very nice fresh lobster taste. The the main course, my friends got the prime steak, medium rare, I've never had steak this good before. It has just the right crust outside and nice and pink inside. Another friend has the duck breast, also the best duck I've had. It has a nice touch of sweetness to it. I did not try the crab cake but my said it's good. I had the grouper, fresh and buttery. We also got 2 sides,  the potatoe puree and the brussel sprout. The Brussels sprout could have been a main dish for vegetarians. It does not have the bitterness at all and the apple goes with it very well. We spotted someone different when they were collecting the plates. It was the owner. He tried to keep low key but we had a nice conversation with him. He also got us something special for dessert. One of the best dinning experience I have ever had.

994,Rockville,2013-11-05,NI7W3q2rCGBTJjIB8lN7qg,3, MD,"I brought my fiance to Blue Duck Tavern on his birthday, based on the glowing reviews and my own research. It pains me to only give this place 3 stars. It has so much potential. The decor is modern and clean yet still warm and inviting; the service was great; and we had an excellent dining experience overall. As other reviewers have stated, the cocktails, while VERY pricey ($18 for a Belvedere and club soda!), are also excellent - way above average. Something I found a little strange and off-putting: I asked for a wine recommendation, and the som pointed out the three cheapest bottles on the menu. I do realize we might have been a little bit under-dressed (most men were in a suit and tie, my fiance wore slacks and a sweater), and I certainly hope that wasn't what drove his recommendations.We ordered the bone marrow and the foie gras to start. Both came out in no time at all and were decadent and delicious, as was the crusty bread that came with them. Our entrees, however, were just ok. I had the Muscovy Duck and my fiance had the Braised Rib based on our server's recommendation - we both agreed the duck was pretty good, but the rib, while tender and juicy, was terribly over-seasoned and salty. We also tried the BDT fries, cooked in duck fat; those were a tad disappointing - somewhat mushy and bland. We finished with delicious lattes for dessert - highly recommended. Our server was great, the restaurant was beautiful and inviting, but the food did not blow us away, so I don't think we'd return for dinner with so many other options in the area (unless someone else was paying!) But we will definitely be back for a bite and a cocktail - that vodka soda was life-changing.",Irena N.

996,Washington,2016-02-05,gjxbrrRtBujduiHP30WGQQ,5, DC,"Just a few days after Christmas in 2015, my husband and I had a divine culinary experience at the Chef's Table at Blue Duck Tavern.  I don't know the best words to describe the deliciousness of the foods we ate.  I am not a food critic or a writer.  But I believe I know manna from heaven when I taste it. We were a party of 18, and to a person, we queried whether the food had made us immortal.    I even started to look down on DC as the Chef's nectar and ambrosia transported us to Olympus.We love the Blue Duck for creating delicacies -- our crispy pig ear salad and oven-roasted bone marrow were a delight.  My husband loves smearing the bone marrow over his baguette.  For the less adventurous, the coffee roasted carrot salad was a rapturous explosion of flavor and happiness on a cold winter evening.   And the house-made vinegar for oysters on half shell was the most perfectly balanced vinegar for raw oysters I have ever tasted.  The vinegar actually did its job with perfection -- that is, teasing out the flavor of its oyster, without becoming the focus.The ambrosia lifted us higher from there.  Beet-cured salmon, spaghetti bolognese, Blue Duck's own french fries -- what an inferior appellation for such a superior experience -- and sour apple brussels sprouts.  The angels sing even as I type.And when we thought we could not be carried any higher, the chef brought us a 45-day aged ribeye that even a steak restaurant could not have handled this masterfully.  The ribeye literally melted on my tongue.  And later, the wood oven roasted scallops did too.  And, of course, the chef astutely balanced textures as well as flavor.  He complimented the melting with crispy fried cauliflower and potato puree.By the time we reached dessert, I felt as though I were reclining on a cloud with my ankles crossed comfortably, while Hebe -- daughter of Zeus and Hera and cupbearer for the gods and goddesses -- fed me my sweets.We had mini apple pies with sorbets and ice creams.  But now if I can speak quite specifically about the pastry chef -- he was incredible.  What I didn't disclose at the outset was that my husband is a huge James Bond fan and our dinner celebration had a James Bond theme.  Several of our courses were inspired by Ian Fleming's novels, and the dessert reflected the theme itself.The pastry chef prepared a tropical entremet that was in fact this wildly delicious ""cake"" -- in air quotes because my description is not just -- with mango and coconut and white chocolate and other spiritual ingredients.  In fact, the Executive Pastry Chef used the white chocolate to wrap our confection in the iconic gun barrel rifling that is James Bond.  Executive Pastry Chef David Collier and Pastry Chef Callie gave life to this magical confection.From now into eternity -- because we do believe we are immortal after this culinary conversation with Olympus -- I want to commemorate every special event in our lives at the Chef's Table at Blue Duck Tavern.  My wedding brunch was also at the Blue Duck's Chef Table, just two years earlier (that's how we knew to go again).  That amazing afternoon was preparation for mine and my husband's baptism into immortality in Matt Demery's and David Collier's capable hands.Thank you Chefs Matt, David, and Callie for sharing with us your vision of food and in doing so, giving us a feast on Olympus. Thank you Marvina for your superior event planning.  And, thank you to the two serving staff who were every bit of exceptional.",China B.
997,Arlington,2011-12-25,wkXVovwmBsIlv0nWKD4JPA,4, VA,"You'll be greeted by a strikingly lofty black gate, modern high ceilings and a glimpse of the open kitchen where the famous apple pies are prepared. Romantic yet almost solemn would be the right words for Blue Duck Tavern standing tall in the evenings. STICK TO THE SIGNATURESOur waitress joked that if they ever take the ""braised beef rib"" off the menu, the restaurant probably wouldn't exist. It wasn't necessarily a joke. The tender dish was so rich in flavor that I would've been perfectly happy with having just this one item, plus, well, the apple pie.The freshly baked ""apple pie"" was beautiful and generously portioned. It could easily be shared by 3 people. We were also fans of the ""collard greens."" As for the duck breast and blue cheese polenta, I've never been too fond of any rare or medium rare duck, and the polenta seemed too liquidy in my opinion.Oh, everything is served family-style. Fun.LESS THAN PERFECT SERVICEDespite the solid food, I was rather disappointed with the lukewarm service we experienced in the beginning. We waited for a long time before someone came to acknowledge us at the table. Although we did receive decent attention later, I wasn't going to be impressed anymore. Spoiled and nitpicky? Maybe, but when I go to a fancy restaurant with a lion's appetite and money to spend, I expect more, or actually, I expect perfection.BY THE WAY, THERE'S A LOUNGEAs we ventured into the lobby of the Park Hyatt hotel after dinner (yes, the restaurant is part of the hotel), we got to see the lounge connecting the two establishments. I couldn't clearly see its interior. But I didn't care. I felt warm and full and I bet the lounge was nice.",Tracy L.
998,Washington,2013-10-31,liRVieHgYjKfpLW2xypOyQ,3, DC,"To bid adieu to my boss of six years, I scheduled a farewell dinner at the Blue Duck Tavern in DC. Upon arrival, we were immediately astonished by how beautiful this restaurant was inside and out. From the outside, the massive doors and floor to ceiling windows revealed a contemporary setting. On the inside, the beautiful decor featuring clean lines, handcrafted wood tables, and 20-foot ceilings leaves one in awe upon first glance. A look around reveals this amazing open, stainless steel kitchen featuring a custom-designed commercial Molteni range crafted in France.We were seated at a table inside the restaurant with a beautiful view of the fountain. The wine list is one of the most impressive wine lists I've seen in DC. An extensive listing featuring exquisite wines organized by country, then by type. I chose our first wine from the Sommelier Selection -- a crisp 2011 Seghesio Arneis from the Russian River Valley.The menu didn't appear to be incredibly vegan-friendly, but our server did say that many of the salads and items listed under the ""vegetarian,"" ""vegetables,"" and ""potatoes and grains"" headings could be made vegan. He introduced these items as the side items and the meat as the main dishes. Minus two points for that one.  I should mention that I indicated on my reservation that I was vegan and when I arrived I inquired about the vegan options, but when our server came back to the table, he immediately introduced the meat specials, then later told me which options I could choose from. I was already beginning to feel like a second-class citizen.When he brought the bread basket out, he included flat bread for me, which was nice. I started with the Baby Carrots salad. This was a large, hearty salad featuring yellow, orange, and purple cooked carrots making for a colorful presentation. The carrots were adorned with shaved fennel, oranges, parsley, and olive oil croutons in a light vinaigrette. It was much better than I would have expected a simple carrot salad to be.For my entree, I ordered the Farro dish with wood oven-roasted baby vegetables including zucchini, yellow squash, eggplant, onion, and purple and orange cauliflower.  It was garnished with crispy garlic and fresh herbs. It was a nice light, vegetable and rice-based dish, but was a little too much on the oily and salty side.I also ordered a side of the Sauteed Wild Mushrooms served with olive oil croutons, garlic, and parsley. It was as good as a simple wild mushroom dish could get.I should also mention that we ordered a fantastic 2009 Nebbiolo Blend from Italy - Proprieta Sperino ""Uvaggio."" This was a big hit with the table.For dessert, I went with a the Cherry Blossom Sorbet. It was served in a huge container that was enough sorbet to feed several tables! It tasted like it had been made in house and had a nice cherry flavor to it.At the end of the meal, our server brought a plate of three chocolates for the four of us. When my coworker asked why there were only three, I remarked that they probably weren't vegan. It would have been nice for him to have said whether they were vegan or not when he brought them out.All in all, it was a nice dinner. I think the best part of the entire experience was really the atmosphere. The design and decor of the restaurant alone make it worth visiting. But, in the end, for one of the restaurants listed as one of the top ten restaurants in DC in the Washingtonian, I was a bit underwhelmed. The food was great and actually very reasonably priced with my entree only being $22 and the sides $10 so I really can't complain about that and the wine list was pretty spectacular. I guess I was just expecting an overall fantastic experience, which I didn't get. I was mostly disappointed in the lack of attention to my vegan diet as the server seemed to disregard me whenever he could. And the fact that they didn't even bring out some type of vegan gelee as they usually do when they bring non-vegan chocolates at the end of the meal was a bit disappointing.  I might be back someday if they add new vegan options, but definitely not anytime soon. And with all the great upscale options in DC, this one doesn't even make the list.",Angela P.

Scallops were cooked perfectly but could have had more seasoning. The apple pie for dessert was good but seemed like it was sitting out as the temperature was mildly warm instead of hot. The waiter was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice dinner in DC.",Justin F.
1000,Arlington,2015-12-21,c2zyvEPRk5ZRZniGMgOZLQ,5, VA,"We dined at BDT for my birthday dinner and every aspect of our experience was exceptional from the service to the food. Our waiter David was welcoming and enthusiastic from the beginning and he was constantly in contact with us during our dinner. He let us try a couple different wine options and we settled on a Napa Meritage Claret which was wonderful. We started with the Smore Foie Gras and it was sensational. Think of your classic pan seared foie accompanied with graham cracker, chocolate and marshmallow.For entrees, we had the duck breast and the lamb shank, along with the polenta and brussel sprouts. In addition, I had mentioned the BLT fries and David brought them out free of charge. The duck was perfectly cooked, with a crispy skin and beautiful, tender meat. The lamb shank literally fell off the bone and was extremely rich with flavor. The polenta was rich and velvety with notes of cheese and cream, and the brussel sprouts worked really well with the sour apple. For dessert, we shared the Caramel Pretzel which was a wonderful combination of sweet caramel, ice cream and salty pretzel.Whether you are celebrating a birthday or special occasion, or just want to treat yourself to one of D.C.'s best spots, you must experience Blue Duck Tavern.",Elliot C.

1002,Sterling,2012-04-29,-J9t0CKi5U6b0jtwRo2XQg,4, VA,"I'm only reviewing their drink service in this writeup.BDT is a nice, classy restaurant and lounge that's paired with the Hyatt next door. That being said, BDT itself could definitely stand on its own and still thrive. My friends and I had passed by before and tried going in late in an evening before, but it was closed. This time, we went in earlier on the night (9pm) with a group of 9, and we decided to hang around for some drinks. The outside of BDT is very nice, something that reminds me of what you'd see in the south, with its large rocking chairs, tables and benches outside the foyer. Once you open the large, cathedral doors, you can see that wood is the theme and is everywhere. This is a plus in my book, because it provides a cozy and intimate ambiance that pairs perfectly with low-brightness lighting that BDT uses.We were seated at a long wooden bar table, and our server came around to take care of our drink orders. The drinks menu consists mostly of classic cocktails that focuses on quality ingredients and professional preparation, though they do have a selection of quality beers as well. I got the Stormy Morning and also a Thyme-Lavender Foam cocktail. Both were extremely good, and I especially enjoyed the sweet, Lavender Foam that topped my second cocktail. Our waitress was kind and accommodating, and she kept us happy with the warmed pistachios nuts that the bar serves. My friends were impressed with the whole experience, and I think we're all planning to visit BDT again (and possibly try out the food) soon.Though we were dressed somewhat casually, I do suggest not entering in jeans and a t-shirt.",Albert L.
1003,Spalding,2016-07-14,AVuwyYMsvsiRj4gKLez3DA,4, United Kingdom,"I'm from England, I miss the food in London, the menu here reminded me of dinning out in London - some different types of food/cuts of meat (quail was on the menu when we went) and more sophisticated than a lot of restaurants I dine in in the US (certainly the DC/NOVA area). The pork chop was succulent and the flash fried broccoli with garlic and chili was delicious. Beef tartar to start was pretty good too. Big place, we ate outside - someone said inside can get noisy. Good service, the waiter was from Europe and very friendly/helpful. They did get my dining partner's side wrong, but quickly rectified.",Richard K.

1005,Washington,2013-09-24,Vl8p86R-hmxm8Q-GMi-Eqw,5, DC,"This is my first five star rating in a VERY long time, and Blue Duck Tavern deserves every one of them. We rolled in over the weekend for Sunday brunch and were seated outside in the patio.We proceeded to order the following: 7085 bloody marys, watermelon juice, the flowery earl grey tea, 28282283 mimosas, the sticky buns, and charcuterie board. Ok, maybe there weren't thousands of drinks at our table, but it seemed like it, and that's ok. The highlights for me were the sticky buns (YOU MUST GET them), watermelon juice, and the house mustard on the charcuterie board. Yeah, the house freakin mustard. It's delicious. So amazing that I asked the waitress what was in it, and the sous chef actually ended up sending me the recipe card. Customer service doesn't get any better than that, my friends. As for the entrees, we ordered the eggs florentine and short rib hash. They were alright. The short rib hash was a bit too salty for me, but there's just something incredible about breaking open a fried egg and watching the yolk effortlessly descend toward the bottom and mingle with the horseradish sauce to become this rich savory bite. I probably ate an entire loaf of bread just trying to scoop up as much as I could, it was just that great. We had to order the fig sorbet, because it's just not an item you see often and we were curious what it was like. It's sweet and almost syrupy in texture when slightly melted on your spoon. I loved the big fig flavor and felt like it was a great way to end the meal, which definitely was not cheap, but absolutely worth it. The service was very attentive and timely. I highly recommend coming here, and expect to be here much more often in the future.",Jess M.

1007,Arlington,2013-12-29,rLNGpc_UeDXZkyGuT8X2bA,5, VA,"The Blue Duck Tavern is the whole package. Great place to bring visitors, in a nice part of town attached to the Hyatt, tasteful, modern, and clean, with great food to boot. The kitchen/food prep area is right next to you, complete with chefs in white hats, sparkling pots and pans, and mounds of bright granny smith apples. As I walked in, I passed a baker sliding freshly baked sugar cookies off the pan just out of the oven. It adds up to a classy joint, and the transparency gives you full confidence in your food (I'm sure that the kitchens of many restaurants are in sore need of some hygiene overhaul).On to the food. You're getting a high bar of average quality in both food and service for the price you pay. The dl on what we tried for brunch: the bone marrow appetizer is a must try; the marrow melts in your mouth, complete with melted pumpkin butter for a hint of autumn, and browned granola bits forming a decadent crust. I had the short rib hash, which was mouth wateringly savory and filling, complimented with a biscuit to mop the juices. We also tried the hamburger, which was excellent but not extraordinary- stick to some of the more unique things on the menu. The fries were thick, hearty, and well crisped, with a nice horseradish mayo but could have used more of a kick of seasoning. Afterwards we were stuffed, but made room for the apple pie and pumpkin flan, which were both good but don't worry if you miss out. The apple pie had a crunchy caramelized crust on top and the apples were tart with just the right tad of sweetness. However the side and bottom of the crust were just so-so.Overall a classy dining experience for a good price. I'll be back to try more!",Margaret D.

Needless to say that did not really happen. The server was very nice but kinda slow. We started off with the bone marrow which was up to par with all the other reviews. We got duck breast, pork chop, fries, mushrooms and ended our dinner with corn ice cream. I must say the mushrooms and ice cream were my favorites. All the other foods besides bone marrow was sorta cool and underseasoned. The fries tasted stale as if they were sitting under a heat lamp. Not crispy and no seasoning. Maybe they had an off night or maybe it's the way it is who knows. I probably wont be back since there are tons of other options in DC.",Dong K.

There are 4 pieces and garlic bread  that you can put the marrow on. Soooo good.Also got the crab cakes, suckling pig, wild mushrooms and braised beef rib. The beef rib was my second favorite of the meal. If you suck on the bone, you can really taste the housemade steak sauce. Delicious! Suckling pig was not very impressive. Liked the crab cakes and mushrooms though.For dessert we got the apple pie with vanilla ice cream, and the nectarine blackberry crumble. The vanilla ice cream is $9 but its definitely made in house and is so worth it. The apple pie was fantastic. I was so full but I still ate it anyway. The blackberry crumble was nice to try but it was really sugary. I would pass on it in the future.Spectacular service. Very cool open kitchen here that you can walk through on your way to the bathrooms. Loved the Hyatt bathrooms with a sink in each stall.

The sides were extraordinary, potato purée with shaved truffles on top, along with oversize aioli fries. The potato purée with truffles was a taste out of this world. For dessert, it was like a tour of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, with S'mores atop a warm liquid chocolate configuration, and our server brought out a sampler of root beer, vanilla cream, chocolate and fruity pebbles ice cream.

I chose 3 out of 5 stars because although the service was outstanding the food didn't leave us with any actually desire to return.  Nothing really stood out and we can all say that we've had better with each dish that we ordered.   If you are looking for posh experience than this might be the place for you, but if your looking for great food plus the experience I would probably go elsewhere.",Raj P.

My boyfriend had the suckling pig which was so tender and perfectly cooked. My crab cakes were amazing -- all crab, no filler whatsoever. The Royal Mint cocktail was so refreshing and minty and just great to wash down all the rich flavors. If you happen to get the Whiskey Roobois cocktail, ask for half the simple syrup. The first one was entirely too sweet but the waitress quickly replaced it and was so nice about it. And of course, the apple pie. We were beyond stuffed after dinner but couldn't help but order it.

My boyfriend loves this restaurant so he was very excited to bring me here for dinner when I accompanied him into the city this weekend. We ordered the aged ribeye for two, which was delicious. Unfortunately our waiter David was honestly the most rude and negligent server I have had the misfortune to come in contact with, possibly ever. My boyfriend sat next to me instead of across from me and David, our waiter, clearly did not approve. After first sharply asking if we intended to sit ""like that"" for the whole meal, he was huffy in setting our plates. Our waters remained unfilled for most of the dinner, we poured our own wine, another server brought our food, we had to ask for a dessert menu, our table crumbs were not wiped and we waited over 20 minutes for our cappuccinos after dinner. All the while he offered those courtesies to the tables to our immediate left and right. I felt really bad for my boyfriend who had raved about the Blue Duck as I could tell he was  embarrassed that my first experience was so bad. Even still we did not stiff our rude waiter. We left David a 10 percent tip, which was much less than the 20-25 percent we standardly tip but $20 was still much more than he deserved for making us feel so unwelcome.

I am in love with BDT and applaud them for being an establishment that puts forth the effort to keep their patrons happy.We went here on a Saturday for a spontaneous date night without reservations. We did call ahead and was told that the next available table for two was at 10:45 pm, but we would have a better chance at the bar area. So we headed over around 7 pm. Needless to say the place was packed. We managed to grab two seats at a communal table (note: the place is kind of like a maze with many entrances and the reception desk is difficult to find). We asked to be notified when one of the tables in the bar area opens up, and luckily, they were able to move us over before we ordered.And the food! The brussel sprouts were crispy on the outside and cooked perfectly to the inside. Maybe a bit salty, but tasted amazing with the bread and pork. The scallops were fresh and juicy, and the pork was so tender. The sauces for both were light and not overbearing. The grits were perhaps a tad buttery but were the best grits I've ever had. The beet and endive salad with goat cheese was delicious as well.I could not have been more happy with my experience at BDT. My meat-afficionado husband was a bit disappointed when our server couldn't answer his questions as to which part of beef, pork, or venison they would be serving, but she made up for it by making the right recommendation!

1028,Honolulu,2012-07-11,gG9PinuntmtR6-yOkqFBBQ,4, HI,"4.5 stars.As others have noted, the restaurant is located in the Park Hyatt Hotel. The atmosphere is dim and chic, with high ceilings for an airy feel but can be interpreted as a bit cold seeming. The open kitchen makes the place a tad informal, and you have to walk through the pastry section of the kitchen to get to the bathrooms which can be a little intrusive.  I guess it's their way of putting you in touch with your food! My husband got the 12 Hour Roasted Suckling Pig from VA. With baby Vegetables, Mustard Jus. There's a thing that looks like a baseball mitt over the dish which is actually a sheet of fried pig skin. It was light and not at all greasy. The meat was fantastic, smokey, tender.We had the Oven Roasted Bone Marrow from Creekstone, KS. With Ramp Butter, Country Bread. This was freaking delicious. They give you half a roasted garlic bulb, from which you pluck out a few cloves and schmear it onto the buttered toast. Plop the marrow on top and you were taken on a wild ride.I had the Wood Oven Roasted Maine Scallops from Viking Village, ME. With Black Mussels, Sea Beans, Lemon Butter. Scallops were super sweet and the meat was dense, unlike some bigger scallops where the grain is sort of floppy. Mussels were small and sweet. The sea beans were alright.We had the sautéed Wild Mushrooms from Kennett Square, PA. With Olive Oil Croutons, Garlic, Parsley. It was good.Blue Duck was really good and we're glad we got a great meal. I wouldn't describe it as the ultimate mind-blowing meal, but Hawaii seriously lacks good New American food and we were happy with the caliber of food here.",Doris D.
1029,Rockville,2013-10-07,vrxWR7ryPCxJyAvx9Rhw1w,3, MD,"Nice atmosphere, wide open kitchen, classy type place.  The menu isn't huge but it's good.  There are no appetizers other than a few salads and 1 soup.  We sent the beet salad back, didn't like it.  But the Kale salad was awesome.  The bread must be baked fresh on premises, it is displayed on the outskirts of the kitchen.  It was good but nothing special.  The drink menu is pretty awesome, they have a great selection.  The braised short rib was AWESOME and there was absolutely no need for a knife it was so tender.  The crab cakes were pretty good, but they were very lemony and nothing special.  The fries were good, really big and piping hot but not mind blowing by any means.  The cauliflower side dish was good.  Service was pretty good but frankly our waiter had no real idea of when to just leave us be and when to check on us.  It felt like we were his only table, which can be a good thing or a bad thing if the server doesn't just 'get it'.  Anyway, overall it was an enjoyable evening but honestly I can't see us rushing to come back here anytime soon.",Donnie S.
1030,Honolulu,2012-02-19,tXEKVYi9Eh3PIJ4k2cwwtw,4, HI,"I was pretty pleased with my meal at blue duck, I'd say 4.5 stars. Let's break it down by dish (cocktails are great too btw) :Butternut Squash Soup - I normally really dislike butternut squash soup, but this time it was really one of the best soups I've ever had. It wasn't too sweet and had a lot of different seeds and bits of dried fruit that really added fantastic textures. I can't say how much more I liked this soup than any other butternut squash soup I've ever had.Roast Bone Marrow - Because my girlfriend is a vegetarian I had to eat this all on my own. Not to say that wasn't great but it's the perfect portion for 2. It comes with a spring or roasted rosemary and a whole roasted garlic bulb that mixed with the toasted bread really made for a deliciously rich crunchy portion of umami.Cheese Rice - really cheesy, maybe too cheesy but maybe pushing your cheese boundaries in a good way. I haven't decided.Scallops and Mussels - Maybe the only real disappointment in our meal. Not to say that it wasn't good but compared to everything else that showed some level of creativity, this was decidedly plain. Sweet Potato Pasta - My girlfriends entree was incredible. I suspect they make their own pasta because the texture was so perfectly chewy I can't imagine it wasn't incredibly fresh. It had pumpkin which i tend not to like for what I often feel like is an overpowering sweetness, but once again was very subtle in this dish.",Misha T.

1033,Alexandria,2014-03-02,m6Za35sC9WBrhROPGKDFjQ,4, VA,"Went here for brunch for my bday and had a great time. Granted someone else was picking up the bill which definitely helped because this place is very pricey. Definitely worth it for special occasions though. And not as bad as citronelle or some of the most pricey establishments. Service was good, using new plates for courses, cleaning the crumbs, nice enough. They did take a little long and seemed young and slightly immature. But nothing to take away from the experience. The ambiance and decor is very unique. All glass and spread out and open kitchen. In a hotel but that makes it seem even nicer actually. The brunch menu had some of the lunch options but tons of delicious choices. I had the short rib hash which was delicious. Ask for the egg poached instead of sunny side to have more runny yolk. So soft and you can tell they cook the ribs for the 18 hours they claimed. The biscuit was ok but a bit dry. Don't order the side order of that go for the pecan pastries.Tons of delicious sides and veggies but the meals were big enough. We couldn't help ourselves though and the brussel sprouts were amazing. Great roast and sauce. The fries are delicious and huge. The burger was so so, I would go for the French toast which is basically a dessert with it being cooked with bread pudding.Dessert wise had some interesting concoctions. We had the deconstructed s'mores and sugar cookies both good. I would ask for more crumb thingies with the s'mores. The apple pie with ice cream looked amazing but just really huge. Oh and drinks, the Chesapeake Bloody Mary was delicious with the taste of real oysters. I had it spicy too and very strong despite not tasting the liquor.",Colin C.

My girlfriend had the potato puree, which was okay, but the beef rib was so succulent and tasted homemade.

The space is modern with light wood and brushed concrete.  Well lit with large Bay windows. There seems to be no real flow to the restaurant with pathways through and amongst tables in eclectic order. Told us table would be ready soon so they sent us to the ""lounge"" for a drink. It is really a tight knop nit space in the middle of the floor with short bar on either side. Service was really non existent. We barely registered with the two servers who managed to ignore us for the 10 minutes for us to decide to give up. Not an auspicious start. It was much better after.

1039,Philadelphia,2015-06-22,v7LoyuuB4hpOjpe4oY361g,2, PA,"We had an 8:15 p.m. reservation on a Saturday evening and were seated promptly.  Our waiter approached and told us about the menu and took our drink orders.  We noticed his initial friendliness upon first approaching our table grew cold, and he suddenly seemed disinterested and aloof.  We received our drinks within a few  minutes, but he didn't visit us again for 30 minutes to take our orders.  In fact, he completely ignored us.  He did however offer excellent service to the tables on both sides of us, offering dessert menus, and later taking their dessert orders, and cleared their plates, all while we sat there very hungry wondering when he would talk to us again about taking our order.  It was thirty minutes after receiving our drinks that he finally returned to our table and took our order.  We ordered, and eventually our food arrived with minimal interaction from our waiter - he even sent his person to deliver meals and drinks and clear our plates for most of the remainder of the evening.  As for the food, we enjoyed some of it.  The bone marrow was delicious, but we were shocked to find many bits of crab meat in our crab cake.  For our mains, I had the chicken-friend quail, and my fiance had the salmon.  The quail was quite good and a very large portion, but my fiance found two large salmon bones in his salmon.  As a chef, I know it can be difficult to sometimes miss crab shell or fish bones, but this is unacceptable at an establishment such as the Blue Duck Tavern.  By the end of the meal, as I stated earlier, we felt let down by the hype of the restaurant, and even worse, felt awful for receiving discrimination by the waiter.  We've been to some of the finest restaurants in the world and never experienced such odd and distateful service by a snobby watier.  There was absolutely no reason we should have received this treatment, and we were horrified that they hire staff that treat their patrons that way.  I know this was said to be the Obamas favorite restaurant, but be warned about the snobby service and lack of attention paid to extra bits of shell and bone in your food.  I'd say don't waste your money on the food and service here.  Go somewhere else with higher standards of quality food and first-rate service to all guests.",Angela A.

The Chef de Cuisine, Brad DeBoy came to our table and described the dishes that were being served that evening. It was a special treat. Moreover, the food was remarkably delicious!

So this is definitely a spot worth checking out if you are looking for good tasting food in a very cool restaurant. My critique: I wouldn't say that this place has food that you have to go out of your way to try. Everything was very rich, it was overwhelming at times. I got a side of roasted beets with the beef rib. But it was like the beets were even heavier and richer than the beef. And then the fries came with a side of thick aioli. I also tried the chicken and it just felt the same way. Hard to articulate but I felt like the chef did not hold back on trying to make everything ""flavorful"" at the cost of losing some much needed crispness/refreshing aspects to the overall dining experience.  I would have done anything for a tomato to just bite into or something like that. That being said - the service was high-level, ambiance was killer, and ingredients/dishes were quality/creative/flavorful enough for a solid 4 stars.",Sean H.

1043,Baltimore,2014-02-10,hohzg_ab-LI3TZwrHbNIlA,2, MD,"Connect the dots..- In a hotel.. more accessible to tourists than locals. - You see the second floor office from your table.. TPS reports anyone?- The huge front door shuts like a drawbridge.- Partially empty dining room has an average age of 50 Saturday at 10:30.- The cocktail list is a flat $15.- Soft lounge-techno has droned on since you entered.- The bread is crusty but cold. So is the well-salted butter, un-spreadable. That's hopefully enough to deter you. Room temp butter is restaurant 101. You're right that we should've bailed but my brain forgot to the connect the dots and continued..Good whiskey sour, too much fruit garnish. Awkwardness from the server. He tried his best. This is a first for me: pointing at a plate, slowly circling round the table behind us as if he's drawn his gun on it, then awkwardly mumbling whether he should take it. This happened more than onceThe duck fat fries were more like Ore-Ida potato wedges without the skin or ample seasoning. Supremely starchy, tasting mainly of oil, and in dire need of salt and pepper. Among the blandest I've eaten, no duck fat detectable, the garlic aioli almost pure garlic. At $1 per ""fry"", we sent back $6.Creamy grits had perfect texture and flavor with the right hints of corn. Grits done simply but incredibly right. Except for the part where the server had to identify by pointing closely with index finger: ""That's the red eye gravy"".Tabasco masked the tartare, the meat more brown than pink, the cubing decent but still some strings, the greens providing only a light though refreshing crunch, the truffle and egg (done perfectly!) contributing to the incredibly rich feel, and the potato hash brown going largely ignored except to sop up egg and Tabasco. Better than average.Foie should never end with ""I have to finish another bite?"" The foie gras texture was correct. Not as creamy, melt-in-mouth as places like Proof, but still right. The flavor was wrong, mainly in the garnish.. stark contrast in the caustically bitter fruit rind, cocoa nibs undetectable, and the too petit chocolate croissant or whatever doing little to cut the oily richness that overwhelms. If Proof's is a dessert masterpiece, BDT's is a burnt main course.Blue Duck is ranked in DC's top 10 but we won't be back.",Kevin K.

Both were really excellent.  The pancake had toasted pepitas that added an awesome crunch. The most unique and fun part was their birthday presentation.

We finished everything & the waiter gave us a small bag of free cookies which was super sweet! We got the bill & I was shocked. Mainly because my small glass of orange juice was 10$!!!!!! I couldn't believe it. I questioned it & he's like yeah that's the right price. I let it go because we got a lot of complementary items, but that is not cool.

1049,Washington,2014-04-25,4IqZrXiQu_NiCVG1Aai_XQ,4, DC,"Even given all the relatively recent staff changes, Blue Duck is still pretty amazing and surprisingly reasonably priced. I do have a few tiny quibbles, for which I docked a star.To start, we toasted my birthday with some champagne as we perused the spring dinner menu and eyeballed the new chef de cuisine at the helm of his open kitchen. They have some decent wines by the glass, so I went with an Oregon pinot for dinner.What we ate: -Bone marrow appetizer - Still my favorite. I swear they've added more parsley to it, which I love, as it keeps the marrow taste a bit lighter and cleaner.-Wood-oven fired Wagyu beef in bearnaise - Really delicious and a very generous portion of steak (I took half of it home). I did wish the skillet it was served in had been heated, as the butter sauce got unpleasantly firm by my second slice of beef. If you watch the kitchen, you'll see that they add many of the glazes/sauces out of pre-prepared squeeze bottles, which is fine, but I want it all hot!-Roasted suckling pig - tender and mildly sweet. My husband like this.-BDT fries - fries in duck fat, served w/ garlicky aioli. Of course they're delicious, how could they not be?!-Carrots w/ hazelnuts - my tiny quibble is that the presentation could have been more appealing. I was hoping for some whole carrots!-Meyer lemon icebox cake - a nice, light way to end the meal. Familiar flavors, but lightened up and deconstructed on the plate. Perfect w/ espresso.-Scoop of vanilla ice cream (complimentary)Service issues:-The hostess was not so good. When I arrived, there was a party of 5-6 spilling out into the street with doors flung open, despite the fact that there was plenty of room to wait inside. It was a cold night, and I think the staff should have enforced that a bit better. The hostess simply asked my party to take a seat in the rocking chairs - no offer to take my cumbersome trench coat as I tried to balance it on my large purse. You looked up the reservation, so you know it's my birthday! Offer to take my coat! She also looked at me as if I were an alien when I asked about the restroom in between courses. -We could not for the life of us understand our server! I'm pretty good with accents, but he was a low talker to boot. He did oblige my husband's request of a signed menu, so all was forgiven. :)I know the above (food temperature, hostess' helpfulness, and server's abilities) are pretty minor, but a place consistently on the list of best DC restaurants should get these things figured out.",M.

I'd be lying if I said that mac and cheese wasn't one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten in my LIFE. For our entrees I had slow roasted pork and my boyfriend had a delicious New York strip. Both were absolutely mouthwateringly delicious. We also had the fries and Brussels sprouts for our sides. The Brussels sprouts weren't exactly my favorite, I found them to be a little too salty, but they were tasty nonetheless. Finally for dessert we had butterscotch pudding with gold chocolate on top. It was nothing short of fantastic.

Service, food, atmosphere, you name it this place has it.From the minute you walk in and walk past the marble counter dessert bakery, you already know you're ordering dessert. You get seated and your server/server assistant  is there within a minute to great you, pour water and see if there are any immediate questions and take a drink order. Drinks are usually delivered very quickly and the servers always have a few personal favorites and can steer you in the right direction.The scallops and braised beef are phenomenal. Basically any entree I've had here has been one of the best. The only thing I thought was over rates were the BDT fries. While house made and all, they're average.

I'm giving Blue Duck 5 stars with the caveat that we went with another couple who has a connection to the restaurant so I am sure we had particularly outstanding service. That said, I have never had better service in my life. A truly fantastic experience. Our server was professional, friendly, knowledgeable and never harried. Our waters were always filled, as if by magic, and the plates and silverware were taken at just the right time with no intrusion into our conversation at all and our food was cooked perfectly. If this is the experience everyone has here, then Blue Duck Tavern really has something special.The cocktails were true boozy gems without pretension. The wine was delicious and the menu was perfection. We ordered the heirloom tomato salad, which was my least favorite dish we ordered for no good reason other than that it was uninspired. I would not return here without ordering the lamb belly. Wow. Two of our party had the wagyu hangar steak and the other two of us had the suckling pig. You know both were divine because the table fell completely silent once the food was served. My suckling pig was incredible and the steak was cooked to perfection and clearly high quality meat. We had snap peas, fries, mushrooms and potato puree as our sides. I would highly recommend the fries. They were gone first and we could have ordered another but restrained ourselves. For dessert we had the chocolate raspberry cake which was the loser of the night, but our vanilla ice cream and cookies more than made up for the blandness of the cake. Don't forget to order coffee too.I can't wait to come back as a non-vip and try some of their other dishes.",Maria B.

1062,Philadelphia,2013-10-08,KgAUyfxA9iFGndj3Wlonfw,3, PA,"After many friends' praise, I made a reservation here to treat my cousin while visiting her in DC. Obviously my expectations were high, but the menu seemed like it could do no wrong... I love comfort food. The best part of the menu is that they tell you were their menu is sourced from. Being from PA, I was glad to see lots of familiar places. We started the meal light since we noticed a lot of heavy entree options. We opted for oysters and mimosas. She tried the pomegranate orange mimosa, which was a little sweet for me, and I had the pear rosemary, which was just right.For our main dishes, we got fried chicken and waffles, the breakfast sandwich, and the hashbrown with cheese fondue. The hashbrown is amazing; it's just one large square of potato that is deep fried and placed upon this delicious cheese sauce. The sausage on the breakfast sandwich was good and very flavorful, but the biscuit was very dry. Having just come back from Tennessee 2 weeks ago, these were a big letdown. Lastly, the fried chicken and waffles. The waffles were so light and fluffy that I could tell right when I touched it. They were delicious. The fried chicken was so juicy and had good flavor because they were bone-in dark meat. As I cut around the bone and removed it, I noticed that the blood from the bone was all over the meat. Seeing as how chicken is white meat that should be cook thoroughly with no bright red blood, I brought this to my waitress' attention. She offered to bring me a new plate, which I accepted. Right after she took my plate away, she came back with a message from the chef. He had said that they brined the chicken and so do not be alarmed by the pinkness; he will use a thermometer to double check that it is at a done temperature. I don't doubt that he is a good chef, but in this case I could have gotten really sick from the blood. It was not on the bone... it was on the meat after the bone had been cut away. That is what alarmed me. I felt like his ""message"" had a little bit of attitude behind it. While we were waiting for a new dish, we had to grab the waitress' attention to refill out water glasses. There was a large party sitting next to us and clearly we were no longer a priority and probably seemed fussy for questioning a dish.They brought a small bag of cookies for me at the end of my meal for my troubles, which I appreciated. Though for a brunch that cost over $100, I was not thoroughly satisfied. Service is much better at the Park Hyatt lounge right across from Blue Duck Tavern.",Victoria L.

1064,Laurel,2014-01-21,SfFxO6PrrAXw2jbEIINJow,4, MD,"I've only been to BDT twice but I really like this place!Between you and me I prefer the lounge side of the house to the ""restaurant"" side.  The whole restaurant is beautiful with floor to ceiling windows and wine and spirit bottles encased in glass.  The lounge is first come first serve with plenty of seating.  In terms of ambiance this spot ranks high in my book.Between the two visits I've had the opportunity to try several dishes mostly starters, two drinks, two desserts, one entree and a partridge in a pear tree. :-)  Some of the dishes that stood out...  (1) Roasted Cauliflower with cheddar, almonds and raisins....(Side Bar: Have you ever order an appetizer to split with a friend and later regret you have to share?! Well this is one of those dishes.), (2) Baby Kale Salad, (3) Crispy Skin Salmon with Beet Purée and (4) Roasted Organic Chicken.Desserts and Drinks...  The Apple Pie is very flavorful, the crust is really what gets you.  The Milk Chocolate S'mores while not bad I thought it was missing something to bring all the components together.  As far as drinks, I had the bartender make me a Caipirinha which was ok, I like mine a tad sweeter but when I selected a drink for their cocktail menu it worked out better...the name of the drink slips my mind....*something* Spritzer (made with Aperol).Oh, the service...exceptional, they don't miss a beat.",Nicole G.
1065,Los Angeles,2014-05-20,CCrbWArHKuzuh8pVkBeZhA,4, CA,"My boyfriend and I ate here several times during our stay at the Park Hyatt Washington.  First off, I want to acknowledge Alex, who was a terrific waiter and gave us really on-point suggestions.  Five stars for Alex for sure.  Regarding the food, the crab cake here was divine -- I've never had a better crab cake and the cocktail I had (something involving clouds?) was excellent and reminded me of something I once had at Jose Andre's Bazaar in LA.  What I wasn't a fan of was the breakfast -- everything we ate was very heavy and gave me a bit of a stomachache afterwards -- though I will admit that the poached egg (done in olive oil) that I had was perfect.  Another thing that irritated me was that the hostesses were always very snooty and not welcoming at all... We came a total of three times over the course of two days, yet they were always unfriendly.  Overall though, the restaurant is beautiful and the ambiance is quite nice, so I will probably return again the next time I'm in DC.",Amy C.

1067,Silver Spring,2013-12-08,Ilnk7j9cLz5hFXwXaAa3iA,4, MD,"Pretty hard to imagine but this simple American fare restaurant just nails the basics so well.  It would be a great place to take a fussy eater.Sides and main dishes are prepared simply without a lot of fanfare. But its the quality that shows.  Kale salad is crispy, sweet and complimented with a fantastic dressing and hard cheese.  Polenta is slightly salty and runny, but flavorful with nice pearl onions that are fun to burst into.  Crab cakes are solid, no cheap fillers here or much of any, the chicken is juicy and melts with the breast not overcooked.  But the salmon upstages everything.I have had lots of bad salmon in my life, but when a place serves salmon that is better than its crab things need to be said.  Really need to be said!!Soft, buttery, warm, cooked perfectly, with oily jewels of fat running through it, topped sometimes with a crackly skin.  It was extraordinary.Service was congenial, and everyone I was with loved everything they had.  Everything!Easily a good place worth going to.",Ethan L.

Charcuterie was really a bunch of pates, and a very meager sampling of meats. The waiter said something about the real charcuterie being served only in the lounge area. The suckling pig was okay. Nothing fantastic. I didn't like the 'square' presentation but that's a matter of taste I suppose. The rib was good but small. The sides were average. The price was high. Dessert was s'mores and supposedly excellent apple pie. Both were average. Interesting, but not worth it.",Faysal I.
1070,Bethesda,2014-07-01,KqtN17LRFRxlc9aK7-Bl0w,3, MD,"Overall - a 3.5. This place was hard to rate because certain components were excellent while others were just meh.Ambiance - 4. We sat outside as it was a nice evening and were seated near the fountain. The tables are well spaced from each other, which I loved. Would've been nice to have some background music going to drown out the occasional sirens that passed by.Service - 4. We had reservations and showed up a couple of minutes before hand. We saw that there were PLENTY of tables open, and yet there was a line at the hostess stand. I don't know what kind of system they use, but it's not very efficient. It took way longer than it should have for the hostess to see us, check our reservation and then pass us off to be seated. As it was we stood their waiting for her to fiddle with the computer before we could be on our way. The waitstaff was excellent though. Drinks - 3. I ordered the pomegranate lemon which was tart and delicious but overpriced at $9 (considering there was no alcohol in it...). My husband ordered a glass of wine. We go out to eat at nice places semi-frequently, and he noted that this place had one of the most expensive wine lists he's ever seen. Food - 3. Since the BDT has  such a cult following around their signature dishes, I felt like I had to try them for myself. With one exception, I generally found the food overrated.Bread & Butter - 4. I feel the need to rate their b&b, because I hate when I sit down to a nice meal, only to be served rock-hard butter. How are you supposed spread that?? BDT has incredibly soft butter. The bread was nothing special, but the butter was excellentRoasted Bone Marrow - 5. O.M.G. These things were AMAZE-balls. I've had bone marrow only twice before, once making it myself and the other time at Range. BDT's preparation blows it all out of the water. I was hesitant with the current preparation of horseradish and parsley, but the flavor was subtle and not overpowering in the least. In retrospect, I wish I had ordered this as my entree too.Baby Wedge Salad - 3.5. A solid salad. The green goddess dressing was light and herby and the little flecks of jerky complimented it well.Roast Duck - 3. I was underwhelmed. After the rock-star marrow, I was super excited for my duck, but it was just okay. It wasn't super hot which may have been part of the problem, but it just didn't wow me. Parts of my crispy leg were delicious, but other parts were overcooked. The rhubarb butter was a nice compliment though.Crab cakes - 3.5. My husband and I are both very picky with our crab cakes. These scored high on the lots of crab/little filler scale, but were a bit too lemony to be excellent. Plus, I think all crab cakes need some old bay somewhere nearby. The frisee was overdressed with the lemon vinaigrette. I'm also skeptical about their origin. The bay is having serious issues with crabs right now to the point where even local restaurants on the eastern shore are having to import them in so I'm curious how the BDT is pulling it off. Perhaps they were merely picked in MD?BDT Triple Fries - 1. These sucked. There seemed to be two camps on yelp regarding these fries. Either people think they're amazing or people think they're blandless hunks of potato. My husband and I fit in the later category. They had zero flavor. I took to dunking mine in my duck au jus which made them more palatable, but not by much. Even taking them home, sprinkling them with old pay, and dunking them in ketchup didn't make them particularly good.Apple Pie a la mode - 2.5. For such a signature 'wow' dish, this left me unimpressed. I usually don't order apple-based desserts, but I've also had some truly incredible ones (hello Tarte Tatin from La Chaumiere!). I figured based on reviews this would be incredible. It was not. The apples were well caramelized, but the crust wasn't as flaky as I wanted, and the top which was drizzled in caramel tasted overcooked, bordering on burnt. A bummer. It also desperately needs the ice cream, which is $4 extra. At least add a little squirt of whipped cream on the thing!",Lauren W.

1073,Seattle,2015-04-19,zYbBt5zTb1JzymQbIeVd4g,2, WA,"I'm of two minds about how to rank this restaurant.  The food was excellent, I'll give you that - from our starter to our mains to our drinks, it was amazingly tasty.However, we had such lackluster service that it's impossible to give more stars.  We had a reservation, yet had to wait to be seated.  Once we were seated, no one came by to greet us, give us water, or anything.  After waiting 10 minutes, I had to get up and find a waiter to ask for water.  While he was perfectly pleasant, it still took him several minutes to serve us.  We then had to wait for our menus.  When a different waiter finally returned to take our order, we waited and waited for our starter...our drinks didn't arrive until after our mains had arrived - which, you guessed it, was also after a considerable wait.  Meanwhile, tables that were seated after we'd arrived had their food being served before we even ordered!  In fairness, we did end up having our drinks & starters comp'ed - but because this wasn't mentioned when our bill was presented, we felt the need to ask if this was intentional or another oversight on their part.  All in all, it was an awkward event, instead of being a lovely anniversary outing.  I didn't expect that I would have to assertively manage our meal instead of being able to enjoy it.  To be honest, I'm not comfortable recommending this restaurant for an event in which one is depending on reliable service.",Yasefue P.
1074,Arlington,2013-09-29,7kAzf7DjkRXyQEV37fXIzQ,4, VA,"I came to Blue Duck Tavern with very high expectations and did not leave disappointed. The restaurant is very upscale and the food is meant to be eaten family style. If you come here hoping to get just one entree for yourself, you may be disappointed as it is expected that you will be ordering sides. We started our dinner with the bone marrow appetizer (summer version) - which came with four pieces delectably encrusted with peppercorn and truffle, and perfectly toasted french bread. My friend and I shared the mushroom barley risotto, the braised beef rib dish, and the wild mushroom side dish. The mushroom risotto was good but there was an unexpected citrusy flavor which was a bit off-putting if not accompanied by the beef rib. The braised rib, on the other hand, was as good as it gets! Perfectly tender and flavorful, the rib is definitely a standout dish for BDT. We finished our meal with the highly recommended apple pie and a side of vanilla ice cream.While the food here was very good, the service was above and beyond anything I would ever expect. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the items on the menu and spoke truthfully when asked questions about preference, portion size, etc. While he was very professional, there was not an air of pretension in his attitude and he made us feel comfortable and welcome during our entire time there.",Saara Z.
1075,Arlington,2013-04-07,UlNzPo6TTQpA8Sh5JH793A,3, VA,"I was looking forward to lunch at Blue Duck Tavern based on the food descriptions and pictures on the Yelp site. However, once there, I was disappointed with the actual availability of many of the items that I was interested in trying. The lunch menu is rather sparse for vegetarians. I understand this is not a vegetarian restaurant and I am familiar with what other non-vegetarian restaurants tend to offer in terms of variety, and Blue Duck Tavern was lacking in that area. I could basically choose between a couple of sides and two different salads. I ended up ordering the shaved Brussel Sprouts salads with apples, walnuts, parmesan cheese and a tangy dressing. The salad was overly dressed and was nothing special. I only ate half of the salad. I also ordered the duck fat fries which I doused in honey mustard and then realized that the fat content was not worth the bland taste, so I gave up on the fries. My friend had the salmon, which he thought was fine. I don't think anything on the menu looked too appealing to him either since he ended up eating mostly bread from the bread basket...I think something like 9 pieces of bread. He tends to like flavorless food which must be why he ate so much bread because the bread and butter were quite flavorless. Even the water was mediocre and luke warm...you know the kind that's sweating and only has one lone, mostly melted ice cube floating around.I was going to order a cocktail because I had seen some nice online cocktail reviews but I was not impressed with the offerings. For dessert, I ordered the vanilla honey ice cream and goat caramel sauce since that too was raved about on Yelp. There was nothing notable about it except for the presentation (it's presented in an ice bucket with a wooden spoon and a separate jar of caramel sauce). Basically, my dining experience was bland at best.  The breakfast menu looks far more appealing than the lunch menu. The space is beautiful and relaxing. Service is a bit too relaxed. We were there for two hours and everything and everyone moved like molasses. The table turnover was phenomenally slow and the same dining guests where there the entire time we were. If you really like to take your time, this is the place to go. The staff is well dressed and coiffed. Our server looked like Zooey DeschanelIt has been difficult to get reservations and I knew I was going to be approximately 20 minutes late due to the fact that my GPS continuously navigated me  to 91/2 street. The hostess told me that was fine because they had a 15 minute grace period. I was going to arrive 5 minutes past the grace period so I thought they might revoke my reservation, but it ended up not being that busy when we arrived. In hindsight it would have been nice if she had simply said that they were not that busy rather than mentioning the irrelevant grace period.",Angel W.

Came here after a wonderful night a the Kennedy Center.  Opted for the Valet Parking so that I wasn't spending all night looking for a spot.Very courteous hosts at the front checked our reservation and brought us promptly to our table.  We informed our server that one of our party had Celiac disease, and were extremely sensitive to any gluten.  He understood, and came back with a menu that was marked up to show what was GF, and what could be made GF.We wound up picking these items:Appetizers - complementary GF bread (potato starch) along with Foie GrasMain entrees - Roast Chicken and Seafood platter (calamari, mussels, swordfish) and their signature FriesDessert - chocolate smores with coffeeEverything was done to perfection.  The bread really opened my eyes as to what can be done GF, and the Foie Gras was amazing.  The roast chicken had a crisp outside crunch while the meat was succulent and juicy.  The market seafood platter was also very good.  My girlfriend had not tasted any of the seafood items before, and enjoyed them thoroughly.  The signature fries were everything you'd expect a signature dish to be, along with the sauce provided.  Finally the GF Chocolate Smore (no cracker) was a delight .  Such a great experience.  Will definitely come back here as much as possible with family and friends.",David Y.

1083,Arlington,2013-06-08,60EHMoShYHTsx_boGl4T3g,2, VA,"""Overpriced hotel food"" was the consensus of everyone at the table after trying a bite each of our three entrees we ordered. The dishes sounded and looked ambitious, but with all but one plate we found the cuisine to be poorly prepared and flavored, especially considering the price. We started with a nice bottle of wine, some oysters, and a few other appetizers. Each tasted $10 while costing $20. The bone marrow was tasty. the brussels sprouts were a let down. Rock hard butter and cold bread came next and after some confusion our server took our order. Dining at restaurants with non-native English speaking servers is fairly common but our server's thick accent was a challenge. Both my guests (world travelers themselves) agreed we had no idea what specials had been described. He did get our order right though and he up-sold us on some duck fries. The traditional farmhouse modern design of the restaurant worked surprisingly well and I enjoyed the spacious layout. The semblance to rural or southern hospitality ended there. Particularly when it came to sauces and serving size. The three entrees went like this. Crab Cakes: fishy and not fresh, skip it. Roasted pig: no comment. Rack of lamb: amazing flavor and preparation but by 'rack' they mean 'three tiny slivers' for $45.  The duck fries were a soggy mess and the mushrooms were equally disappointing. When the server checked in with us 'how is everything?'. 25 minutes after the entrees had been served, there was a resoundingly dismal 'pretty good'. He seemed to expect the response and he wisely hid behind the accent and pretended to ignore the tone and body language. There was just too much to really even bother at that point.Despite the barrier of accent our service was well timed and attentive. If you are a fan of places like Outback Steakhouse, Flemings, or Claim Jumper and want something slightly higher class you will be happy. It is also really great they use locally sourced and fresh food. For the foodies:As you enter the grand wooden doors into the restaurant nestled in a corner of the Embassy Westin hotel you might find your foodie-sense tingling 'warning'. Trust your instincts and turn around and walk to somewhere that can stand without hotel guests and vacationers to prop it up. I regret the money I spent.",Joshua W.

It simply appeared to be an aggregation of the top 10 favorite foods in most restaurants. The wines by the glass are almost undrinkable!! I never understand why this is a difficult thing for restaurants to do well. After all, they simply need to order acceptable wines and then serve them, no preparations needed.

1085,Howell,2015-08-08,RvI0PmhIDyAe3-Zx4g7zbA,3, NJ,"Swanky feel but lacking swank in the meal.  The food attempts many flavors but some don't mesh well together, like in the fois gras custard with peanut brittle topping. The bone marrow app was seasoned well, but I have had better. The crab cake entree was delightfully filled with mostly crab, and the scallop special my husband ordered was delicious on his account. The French fries were presented beautifully and had a great flavor to them, but because of the thick cut, they tasted more like potatoes than a French fry, which wasn't really for me. Overall a pleasant experience enjoying the outdoor patio, yet our waiter was extremely slow. At first I wasn't sure if it was just the ambience to have no waiter cater to you when you are at your table, but then a couple at the table next to us got up and left after no one came to greet them after 10 minutes of sitting there and waiting. Our waiter, however, heard it was our anniversary and after we ordered the apple pie (which was nothing special, lacking flavor), our plate came out saying Happy Anniversary in chocolate!  So I must say I am torn about this review, so that is why I'm giving it a middle of the road 3 out of 5 stars.",Elena H.
1086,Manhattan,2014-04-08,iKgYeBB7DPBp_ihPwby6mw,3, NY,"We stayed in Park Hyatt for the night and decided to try this place since it has pretty good reviews on Yelp. But it turned out to be less impressive than we expected. We had dinner, cocktails, and breakfast here.First of all i really love the vibe. The decors are pretty cool and my hubby and I sit in a small glass room, which is quite interesting. But the food was just meh. -------------------------------------Dinner-------------------------------------Maybe it was also because of what we ordered; I felt everything was so oily and greasy. I feel quite uncomfortable after dinner. We ordered:Bone marrow - I always wanted to try bone marrows but this was the first time I had. No comparison, but this one was just okay. It had a lot lemon and herbs but still a bit heavy.Wagyu beef tartar - beef was good but the dish was a bit blandFoie gras - average; I've def had better ones.Bouillabaisse- again plain, nothing impressive. Also as an entree this one came in a really small portion. Roasted wild mushroom - quite oily again. -------------------------------------Drinks--------------------------------------Apparently finding spaces for 4 people in a Bar on a Saturday night in DC was not easy. So we went back to the hotel, and ended up in the Blue Duck again. Drinks were fine. The desserts were not bad. We had some custard and raspberry Panna cotta. Would give four starts for the desserts.  ------------------------------------breakfast-------------------------------------We had breakfast again in the hotel, since that was included in the diamond member benefits. The Jumbo Lump Maryland Crab with Scrambled Egg Whites was really good. Loved that. We also had some sides and the Egg Florentine, where were average. Breakfast would cost about $90 if we were paying out of pocket, which i think was overpriced. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In general this place was okay.

The location of the restaurant is in the west end of DC, nestled between some of the cities swankiest hotels. At first glance it can be difficult to find the host stand, but after a little exploration you make your way to the bar where cocktails and wine are served while you wait for your table to be ready. The food was incredible, every dish more impressive than the one before it. We ordered everything family style and started with the bone marrow, amazing. For the main courses we chose the duck leg confit with seared duck breast and the suckling pig. Hands down, best duck breast I have ever had, in the orange glaze with baby carrots - need I say more. For our sides we went with the grits and the triple confit fried French fries.... So f#%king good. We were feeling gluttonous that night so for dessert we shared their take on s'mores and everything again was cooked, prepared, and plated to perfection. In fact the only drawback of this amazing experience was the awkwardness of our waiter, but with food that amazing there was little that could have ruined that night.",Matthew B.

Also, service was great with friendly and knowledgeable servers and sommeliers.Highly recommended for a special occasion (it's a little expensive, though not unreasonable).",Tatsu O.

1092,Washington,2014-03-23,x4wlHbvHqD_5qzN9bE0hyQ,5, DC,"The bone marrow is the most delicious dish I had. Absolutely amazing. I didn't know how to eat it with the roasted garlic and the smothering of the marrow. But whence explained, it is divine. The braised beef rib is also tasty and hearty. I really enjoyed the steak sauce the meat was served in with its sweet and savory elements. The atmosphere is elegant and intimate with warm lighting and comfortable seating. We sat at the bar because of the long wait. My only complaint is that there was no  visible wait and half the tables were empty. But who knows? The hostess was still courteous. The bartender who served us was very educated on the menu and selected an excellent pairing of wines for our food. Overall, an awesome food experience to which I intend to return.",Mari M.
1093,Sterling,2013-08-26,zkYVgOeufCZXHT8FTQlcMQ,3, VA,"We had a nice dinner there. Service was very attentive, although a little to formal and stuffy.  I think that is what is expected at a high end hotel restaurant that caters to a lot of tightly wound DC clientele / visitors. Way too many people that I'd expect to see at a yacht club or polo match. No offense to them, but that is just not my bag. Food was pretty good, though I wasn't wowed. I had a wonderful avocado cucumber soup. That was my highlight. Hubby had oysters. For the main course, I had the scallops, which were only seared on one side, and a little gritty. Probably  needed to be cleaned a little bit better. The pork belly that came with it tasted like re-heated pork roast more than the scrumptious pork belly I'm used to when we dine out. My husband's salmon was pretty bland and a bit overdone. I wasn't a fan. Dessert was ok, but not noteworthy by any means. The restaurant is fairly noisy, and tables close together, so there was no way to have an intimate dinner. Overall, it was a nice meal, and we enjoyed ourselves enough, but I wouldn't go back.",Bettina M.

We got: braised beef rib, roasted suckling pig, oysters, foie gras, and roasted mushrooms. Braised beef rib was nothing exceptional. Run of the mill. Roasted pig was dry.Oysters were old.Foie gras was fine.Roasted mushrooms were salty and tough.Went to Red Lobster a few days later and had an epiphany that the food at every franchised sit in restaurant is better than Blue Duck and at 1/3 the price.

The waiter swerved from gracious to irritable ,  water glasses were left unfilled for  lengthy periods of time  and later , leftover food was packed without the sauces , the best parts- even though we specified their inclusion ( and we are not super demanding -- our son is/has been a waiter at several fine dining  restaurants jn the area , so we're understanding ).The food : We've eaten here several times before but not for a few years .  Very ordinary.  The oysters were great ---but not the rest.   Generally,  lacked interesting flavor -- bone marrow used to be great, but now little marrow and lots of mustard ; crab cakes used to be delicious but now dry ( a sauce may have helped ?!) ; and other things - meats and fish basically rare while nothing else interesting about their prep.

It was a freezing cold Sunday morning and it was nice to walk into a nice warm and light atmosphere (huge windows). I liked that there was an open kitchen where you can see food being prepared.We tried:1. Assorted House Made Pastries - It has a plain croissant, chocolate croissant, and blueberry muffin . The butter and jams were delicious and perfectly sweet.4. Biscuit Breakfast Sandwich - The biscuits here are thick, and flaky. Delicious egg with arugula.4. Short Rib Hash - Sunny side egg looked great and the meet was tender. Also comes with a biscuit on the side.5. Hash Brown Potato - This hash brown comes as a cube in cheese fondue.

1113,Union City,2013-09-06,_9W_9LkXMxAVZv6xGPCWOQ,5, CA,"I had the pleasure of having breakfast or brunch here for four days, and dinner one night as well. After taking the opportunity to try about a dozen or so things on the menu, I can tell you that everything is EXCELLENT! Based off of the rave reviews on Yelp and those that I'd heard from friends who live in the area, I had very high expectations to begin with, but BDT still exceeded them! I cannot wait for my next trip to D.C. just so I can book a breakfast, lunch or dinner reservation here, or maybe all three! It's a little pricey, but the food is worth it!Breakfast musts:*Maryland Crab Scramble - simply divine in every way.*Blueberry Muffins & Chocolate Croissants - if you opt for their open breakfast buffet, or order one on the side. They're pastries are a definite must, as are the biscuits!*Natural Garden Scramble - perfect amount of organic veggies and free range eggs unite to create the best omelette I've ever had. I added pepper jack cheese and they added sliced avocado to top it all off. It was so good I had to order this twice, but I substituted smoked salmon for the ham...and OOOOH WOW!*House made smoked salmon - let me just say that I grew up with my Dad and Uncles smoking their own Alaskan caught salmon, with at least 3 or 4 different brines every year. I'm just as picky (if not more) about my fish, smoked or fresh, as I am with my food. But this smoked salmon was very fresh, not salty, and had great flavor. 5 stars just for the salmon!*Short Rib Hash - Excellent, in both portions and flavor. I'd recommend ordering a biscuit with this dish. It's very filling though.*Biscuit Breakfast Sandwich - this is the dish that turned me on to their biscuits! Thick and flaky, like they were shipped in from the South. The sandwich is filling and a nice size.Drinks:*Iced coffee comes in its own glass bottle, steeped for 16 hours. Tastes amazing. And all us coffee lover rejoice!*Hot coffee and/or tea - you never have to ask for a refill because they give you your own carafe! Yes, and THANK YOU!*Fresh squeezed juices - not sure if these are seasonal, but the watermelon, grapefruit, and orange were all delish. I made sure to order one every morning.Dinner Delights!!! Starters:*Flatbread w/ Eggplant puree - a must try for anyone who likes Mediterranean fare and/or ratatouille. This will not disappoint!*Tomato salad with goat cheese - made to perfection. Nice portions.Mains:*Scallops - perfectly medium rare and served with a delectable mango garnish, on pork belly.*Pork braised for 16 hours - I've never had pork melt in my mouth before!Dessert:*Cherry Cheesecake - not the marischino cherries, but the dark, rich, sweetly flavored cherries served with an individual cheesecake with an outer shell made of graham cracker. Impressive presentation, I almost didn't want to eat it because it looked so pretty. But after the first bite, it was all but devoured.*Stone fruit and blackberry crumble - large enough to share between 2 or 3 people! Excellent!",T P.

1117,Gaithersburg,2013-08-31,_qR5mTdEoGIFz3BhTGACNw,2, MD,"We frequented Blue Duck Tavern for all our special occasions (and the occasional cravings). It was always a fulfilling overall experience and  the food was pretty consistent in the past. However,  after our recent experience I doubt I am going to risk tainting another special occasion by choosing this restaurant for my dinner. This time around there were both food and service problems:  we got botched Wagyu Steak. Twice. First time it was the wrong temperature. Second,  the sauce was nothing but vinegar. I know some other reviewers noticed the vinegar issue on other dishes. Sadly, I have to conquer.I wish the food was our only issue that night, but the service was also lacking. Our waiter was nice enough, seemed to know the menu well and made great suggestions. However, after our food was prepared incorrectly the second time around he sort of lost any interest in our table. The dirty dishes were piled up for a while, while the botched Wagyu Steak remained untouched. He waited for the rest of us to finish our meal to come see what was wrong. It's not like he didn't just stand around looking at our table either. I was also surprised by the behavior of maitre d' who came over to see what was wrong, then tried to tell us the access vinegar was meant to balance the rich mean flavor.  That was really awkward, as we are very familiar with the dish and this explanation seemed like an offensive excuse. Then he walked off leaving the dish we told him we were not going to eat on the table... Eventually I had to catch someone (not our waiter) to ask them to clean up the dirty dishes.The only person who tried to rectify the situation seemed the food manager. He did come with apologies and offered for us to reach out to him for the future visit. We also were given an apple pie and cookies for our trouble. While appreciated, I'm not sure how likely we are to come back. Definitely not for a special occasion. P.S. If you do decide to go, I suggest you try to get seated in Michael's section. He is highly professional, knowledgeable and will make your dining a true experience.",Jojo S.

For breakfast, we had the short rib hash and the blueberry pancakes. The SRH was excellent; a generous portion of flavorful short rib with an egg on top and a base of horseradish sauce, better than it sounds, served with a biscuit. Pancakes were fluffy, served with berries, creme, and some crumbles. Service was excellent. For dinner, we had the bone marrow (a tasty and unique experience but not necessarily one that I would rush to do again), crab cake (good but not memorable), duck breast (quite good) with mushrooms, vegetables. Dessert was an apple pie (huge, very good) and peach buckle (very good). Our waiter started off a little cold and then eventually warmed up to us.

1121,Rockville,2011-07-28,HU_YIVgNcUBo2Of2PMUBnA,4, MD,"We came to celebrate at Blue Duck Tavern as per the request of Eating Partner (EP). I suppose I had been gushing enough about it for him to get the hint and shut me up. We arrived at the restaurant fully prepared - right down to our culinary choices. This was going to be a splendid evening.We started off with the bone marrow appetizer. Looks like huge globs of gooey, gelatinous grossness, but on garlicky toast it is the creamiest heaven on earth. I am most certainly not an adventurous eater, but I am grateful for all the wonderful Yelp reviews that led me to this new experience. Super tasty.For our main meal, we split the Muscovy duck breast and the braised beef rib. To my delight, I fell in love with the beef. The flavors and texture infused my mouth with its absolute wonderment. However, as much as I was enamored with the rib, I was in hate with the duck. Disclaimer: I know my duck. I love how fatty their plump butts are and I get it quite often. This duck was the epitome of dry; I likened it to beef jerky. It tasted like beef jerky! It was sinewy and tough and dry. Not only that but I did not care for the blend of flavors. For a restaurant named Duck, I had hoped that its eponymous signature entree would be as fabulous as its reviews. But I was shocked at how wrong my assumptions were!Good thing we ordered a harvest vegetable side, which was a chilled salad with various seasonal veggies sprinkled with goat cheese. Classic summer dish.The apple pie for dessert was overly hyped up. I enjoyed it, but didn't love it the way other patrons seemed to. EP loved the crust but didn't care for the apples. Typical EP.The service was attentive yet aloof so that we didn't feel pressured to leave as soon as we were done eating (although we did just that). The open kitchen is a great spectacle to marvel at on your way to and from the restrooms. The valet parking is a great service at this location (there's no way to get street parking no matter what time of day it is).Overall, I would recommend this place to those who do not appreciate duck. Get everything and anything but the duck and you will have a spectacular meal.",Jueli L.

1123,Arlington,2013-09-03,Ij1JF3KxqUxAur_WVbXx8Q,4, VA,"This was a great lunch stop - not my favorite ever, but I would definitely suggest it for a work/business lunch, or even a relaxing lunch with a few friends (if you're willing to drop some dough!) For me, this wouldn't be worth it to just make a casual lunch stop, but if you're trying to impress - then I'd say the money is worth it.Service: peppy upbeat waiter was great - very knowledgeable of the menu and gave us suggestions which I always appreciate.Food: very very good - hesitant to say excellent though. I like family style and I like personal meals - but I'm not always a fan of mixing the two. At Blue Duck, you choose a main component and then share side dishes. My main component - salmon - was perfectly prepared and absolutely delicious. But the family style side dish wasn't meant to be a side dish in my opinion. It contained big pieces of vegetables that required cutting in order to actually share. It would have been wonderful on my plate - but not when I'm reaching across the table to cut things in half in order to avoid taking everything. Also - small complaint with the bread - not worth the calories and that says a lot coming from a carb-o-holic. Another note: I love their iced tea! They serve it with a mint leaf and simple syrup on the side. The little touches like this really make Blue Duck tavern a special place. My complaints are minimal to the entire experience - I still recommend Blue Duck for special occasions.",Claire B.

1125,Petworth,2013-01-28,Mic6cdgl_FuW5SwhlgRZWQ,5, Washingto,"This is a bit overdue, as last time I are here was early December. This is a great fine dinning establishment, so do expect to spend some money.  But also expect top notch service, super pleasant decor, and incredible food.  First off, this place fills up so make sure you get reservations.  We were able to get 9:30 for 4 on a Friday night with like two days notice so not too bad. We didn't have to wait for a table or anything once we got there.  Best part aside from the food I am about to describe - our server came up to us and asked us if we wanted some champagne, I already had a vodka martini at the bar and said that I didn't want to mix. Sooo he brought us a complimentary round of champagne and I got a shot of vodka instead - what a darling!!We ordered family style - beat salad, barbeque chicken, wild mushrooms, fries, and braised beef. We also got a round of a caviar and pumpkin ravioli.  The caviar was served just like I used to eat it in Russia, on bread with egg, amazing. The pumpkin ravioli was amazing as well. I really wish I could describe the meal more eloquently but it all basically melts in your mouth. Definitely one of the better meals I've had in a long time. The beats came in larger pieces and (I think) were steamed. I am used to more thinly sliced but this worked really well too.  French fries were also larger pieces. Mushrooms and braised beef were my probably my favorite (not by far), very light and airy, perfectly seasoned. I am seriously not doing this food justice so I will stop here. The atmosphere is great, I've been here many times just for drinks, they are not cheap but perfect place to relax and get away from busy/douchy bars in Dupont. It's usually nice and quiet. Older crowd, lots of out of towners, but not gross and touristy. I love the open kitchen, everything is very clean, calm, and minimalistic. Perfect place for special occasions!",Kseniya K.

Needless to say, I left barely able to walk.The apps, we got the scallops and the bone marrow. The bone marrow was delicious although the scallops were good, but nothing to rave about.We got the roasted confit of duck leg with fresh greens and the beef braised rib for our entrees and I have to say the beef rib was just as delicious as it was before - tender and perfect amount for lunch. The duck however, was unexpectedly dry. Maybe there should have been some sort of light dressing even for salad and the duck? It was dry and I couldn't eat much of it - I gave it to my bf. For our sides I got the cauliflower puree (actually it wasn't called that, but I can't remember waht they called it now) anyways I asked is it sort of like a cauliflower mash? Because I had tried that at another restaurant and it was light and like mashed potatoes but with a healthier substitute. The waitress told me it was...so I ordered it. The dish came out and it was EXTREMELY creamy and not at all like what I had expected...it was more like a mac and cheese substance than a mashed potatoes substance. Overall, I still enjoyed it, but it was just unexpectedly different. Collard greens were delicious in my opinion, but my bf was not a fan of it in general.the LAST, best ending of the meal - apple pie with vanilla icecream (the waitress was kind enough to get us a scoop) and pumpkin cheesecake. Please note that this is lunchtime and honestly I was probably full by just eating a piece of their bread. But, i HAD to try it and the pumpkin cheesecake was scrumptious, light, and not at all like a cheesecake! They were wrapped up in the cutest wonton-like structure...as a chinese..i immediately fell in love lol! but really, the pumpkin mixture was amazing. The apple pie was so cute and of course I had a little slice and took the rest home because I was too stuffed.The best part? All of this for a little over $50. I hope they really continue participating in restaurant week and if you get the chance to go during the week, definitely go!!! Service may be slightly slower there, but I didn't mind so much (until we ran out of money for the meter and had to run back out there to put some more coins in!)!",Anne C.

1128,New York,2013-03-06,bEoqS2LJZehH7VBfcoWakQ,4, NY,"Absolutely beautiful. In terms of the ambiance, there really is nothing wrong with the place. The lobster rolls are a must. The burger was standard. The salmon is incredible. The creme brule and apple pies are to die for. When it comes to food, Blue Duck Tavern will make you quack out of satisfaction. The only thing that is keeping me from giving them 5 stars is the fact that it the hostess informed us that there are no more tables available, when virtually all of the tables in the main dining area were unoccupied. Thus, we had to find our own seats in the lounge area, which is impeccably decorated, so I'm not really complaining (maybe just a little bit).",Elizabeth D.

1134,San Francisco,2011-04-29,4Wl29b8yQYx5LoGjtr4KbA,4, CA,So I found this restaurant with the help of you yelpers. Thank you!!! I gotta treat the GF to a great dinner one night while on vacay in DC for an extended weekend.Food:Oven Roasted Bone Marrow. F'n delicious with the little small sliced sourdough bread. It was also served with fresh oven roasted garlic cloves which I'm a huge fan of. Love garlic but don't add too much as this could kill the flavor of the bone marrow.Muscovy Duck Breast-  perfectly cooked and so tender. Every bite you gotta savor in your mouth. My gf ordered this and she kindly offered me a few slices that I obviously couldn't pass up. I ordered the braised beef rib that was super duper tender that I almost melted in my mouth. I can't say anything bad about it. Dessert: Apple pie a la mode which I was disappointed in because it wasn't warm. If it was warm it would have been on point but too bad it wasn't. That's a fail in my book because of that.  My gf did love the crust though and I can't disagree.,Ryan C.
1135,Fairfax,2013-09-28,c3u8kQdgjavnB3nD7l6bTg,4, VA,"My husband picked this place, and once again illustrated the benefit of keeping him around (yes he paid too) :) it was a solid four star experience. This is what we had:- bone marrow: done perfectly with a garlic topping and crispy bread slices- flat bread: nothing special, tasted like bread with arugula- steak hash: the whole concoction was delicious a little salty but good with bread- sticky buns: they melt in your mouth... So delicate but full of flavor.We also ordered a pot of tea for $7 which is a bargain (I paid $9 for a cup at Brasserie Beck).The service was excellent, attentive but not encroaching. I think it is the kind of brunch place that's perfect for girlfriends, families and couples...it's that versatile and accommodating.Here is a telling fact, their patio furniture is from Janus et Cie, they haven't cut corners anywhere and it shows.",Soumeya B.

I'm generally a minimalist when it comes to filets, strips, ribeyes, and other such beautifully dry aged chunks of deliciousness, but this sauce was great. I barely use good sauces, but found myself smothering these perfect, mid-rare squares of strip in this glorious sauce. So at BDT, I guess I'm a sauce person.Crabcakes sublime, despite a couple shell run-ins, which was disappointing, but almost a guarantee with any crabcake, anywhere. Crisp top and bottom that didn't at all interfere with a simple, elegant, perfectly cooked interior, lump crabcake.Apple pie a nice closer.Homerun after homerun, after homerun. Best dining experience in DC. And service best around as well. Awesome evening at BDT.",Eric B.
1137,Warrenton,2015-06-07,o7Fc027I7AcoL1Er_USuVw,1, VA,So my girlfriend and I decide to wake up this morning and go for a nice little brunch after spending a night in the city. I hop on Yelp to look for a good place as I am quite the foodie. I truly liked the menu for Blue Duck Tavern. We take a nice little stroll from our hotel and find it with relative ease. As we approach the entrance two women we asked if that was the Blue Duck Tavern. One woman asked if we were two and started to bring us in. She then asked if we were staying at their hotel. We said we were not. She then stopped and in a rather pretentious tone said the kitchen was closed. She stated that the kitchen was in transition and that we wouldn't be seated. Perhaps instead of posting your hours as being open from 6:30 in the morning until 2:30 in the afternoon you should post the correct hours and lose the attitude. Just my two cents ...,Whit R.

It was a beautiful presentation as well.  Also, although we were seated away from the open kitchen I thought that seeing the food be prepared is a wonderful addition to the ambiance.",Scott J.
1140,Cambridge,2013-04-27,u0-2zHhedlTauILhgiEPzA,2, MA,"I've now been here for both dinner and brunch. Both menus look really exciting, but the execution has always been a let down.Very small portions in both meals. Entrees were about 4 bites - ive definitely had tasting portions more filling than this. For as much as I'm paying, I should at least walk away full. I understand the price tag reflects that you are using quality ingredients and such, but come on, I even left Komi wanting to basically throw up from eating so much (in the best way ever!).  I had thought the waiter was pushy for suggesting I order an additional side to my $20 brunch entree even though I already ordered an appetizer course, but I guess I needed it to be full, and to cut the ridiculous amount of fat and salt in all the entrees.I love fat and salt and have ordered both the famed bone marrow (dinner) and pork belly confit (brunch), but both have been salty almost to the point of being inedible. I didn't even finish the pork belly. A fresh vegetably side, with some crunch and some acid perhaps, is absolutely necessary if these dishes are going to be balanced. Seriously though, why not just include sides or generous garnishes in your entrees to start with then?Service for my most recent brunch visit:  the waiter forgot our bread and, forgot the crispy pig ear on our crispy pig ear salad.  and we found out you have to pay for refills on the regular coffee, to my yuppie heart's despair.It's a nice space and ambience, but given the prices and level of to-do about this place (waitstaff in suits during brunch even), they are really shoddy on details. Left hungry and unsatisfied.",Jane Z.
1141,Washington,2015-04-16,tChjvCg6ghEdrlTtysof2g,5, DC,"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday/our anniversary, and it was debatably the best dinner I've had in DC. Needless to say, it was not cheap - but for the service and the amount/quality of food we ate, it was more than worthwhile. And honestly - we've spent about as much on other highly rated restaurants and were not as pleased with our experience.Absolutely try the brussel sprouts and ham, and if you are feeling indulgent, the bone marrow. I had never had marrow before this meal, and though it was definitely unlike anything else I've eaten, the herb/pitachio/garlic/whatever else crust was incredible. Everything else we had was rich, flavorful, and delicious, and our server was very attentive without being overbearing (and gave us the duck fat fries on the house).The ambiance is also very unique. It has an intimate feel while having enough energy to make it a lively dining experience. I especially loved the seamless flow between the open kitchen and the main seating area. So if you can't tell, I loved it and highly recommend it. I pretty much can't wait for an excuse to go back!",Christina O.
1142,Fairfax,2014-04-02,GLSqCaHx2Z49tGfmfp6Dpw,5, VA,"We had brunch at BDT last weekend and it was a wonderful experience. The ambiance was beautiful and very natural and the staff were all very attentive and dressed well. We ordered the bone marrow and sticky buns to start. Bone marrow was divine and it was our first time trying it. It was perfect spread over a slice of toasted bread. Just a perfect balance of flavor and seasoning. You could really taste all the wonderful combinations of flavors in that dish. I would highly recommend it. The sticky buns were not anything out of this world but certainly were fresh and delightful. I would have preferred more cinnamon and sugar throughout the bun itself but they were still worth trying. As our main entree we ordered the crab cake and the short rib hash with a side of the grits and BDT fries. The crab cake was very good, not the best i've ever had but certainly close. The combination of the crab cake with the watercress frisee salad really complimented each other well. The short rib hash was delicious, especially with the horseradish sauce. The smoked gouda grits was amazing and is a must have side along w/ the BDT fries. The aioli that comes w/ the fries was so good you could have drank it. Lastly we ordered the famous apple pie for dessert bc of all the raving reviews on it. While it was very good it was not served hot and I think if it were warmed before being served it would have elevated our impression of it. We could not finish the entire pie as we were stuffed by the end of our meal so we took it home. The next day I rewarmed the pie to enjoy and it was much more appealing and delectable that way. Over all we had a wonderful experience at BDT and would certainly return again to try their lunch or dinner menu.",Carle K.

1144,San Diego,2011-02-26,A-3QL59wTkd66n0lm1-Bjw,5, CA,"I made a reservation for this restaurant while I was in DC with some friends. We dressed up and went in for a late dinner. The setting was very simple, classy, dimly lit with a homey rustic feel. We definitely splurged that day, but it was so worth it! The restaurant is home-style, so the portions are great to share. And beware, the ice cream comes in a huge pot with 3-4 large scoops in them... save your stomachs :)If you're into the yummy fatty butter/lard taste on toasted bread, you'll definitely love the bone marrow appetizer! I know everyone reviews it, but there's a reason! The dish comes with 3 hearty shanks, a whole roasted garlic and toasted baguette slices. Our other appetizer was the cauliflower soup with lobster ravioli and chive oil. The soup is basically a cream of cauliflower, if there is such a thing. It's absolutely amazing. There is a single ravioli, but it's huge and stuffed with real pieces of lobster, so it's definitely worth it to dig in and get a large chunk even when you're sharing the dish. For the main course, we each ordered one. I got the braised beef rib with homemade sauce. Enough said. The beef has been cooked for hours so it's the right amount of tenderness but with a crisp of a texture between a medium rare and well done, if that makes sense. The presentation was also amazing. Someone else got the duck with huckleberries. It was cut up and you can see the perfect pinkness on the inside. The sauce is slightly tangy and complements the rich meat perfectly. My other friend got the black cod, which is solid... we needed a light dish, but it definitely pales next to the beef and the duck. We're such fatties. Ready? We also got the mac n' cheese which is amazing because for once there is more creamy cheese sauce than the pasta! I'm a fan of the in between stuff so it was a perfect balance. The crunchy layer on top is an added bonus. I combined it with my beef dish and I was on cloud 9. There was also the blue cheese palenta, which wasn't my favorite because it was a bit too rich for me. If you're a die-hard blue cheese fan though, there is certainly enough to satisfy that craving. Still good, it's just a matter of personal preference!For dessert, we got the straight out of oven chocolate cake (which is served with flame torch right at the table!) and the best apple pie ever. We thought it would be nice to pair the pie and cake with a scoop of ice cream on the side, so we ordered the honey vanilla and hazelnut praline. But no, family style serves the ice cream in HUGE buckets with wooden spoons. It was a shock, but who's complaining about extra ice cream right? The apple pie is made in a pot pie style, so there is maximum crust! (my favorite part) The top is also drizzled with a honey syrup which caramelizes and blends in to the crust, giving it a chewy bite. Chocolate cake is meant to be underbaked, so it tasted like a soft cookie and very very chocolatey. I liked that none of the desserts were overly sweet, which is usually a huge qualm of mine. I couldn't have asked for a classier, yummier meal in an amazing city :)",Jen Y.

1147,Rockville,2016-07-29,iVEMDuQMDas-A8fwS65hzw,5, MD,"We picked Blue Duck for dinner before Phantom at the Kennedy Center and wanted to stay close by to make the show on time.  We had 5:30 reservations and arrived a little bit early, so the table wasn't ready yet, so we headed to the bar for a few drinks.  Very cool atmosphere and decor, if not a little bit confusing as you walk through the kitchen and prep area without even knowing sometimes.We finally made it to the bar and were presented some very daunting, comprehensive drink menus.  We picked a few tasty cocktails and were on our way.  They were extremely tasty and stout with some custom in-house infused liquors, but also extremely pricey.  I guess this is what you get for ordering drinks at a $$$ restaurant in a hotel, but 3 drinks cost $50 before tip.On to dinner, we were seated outside as it was cooling off on a muggy DC night, and our server Marcin (sp) came to greet us.  Very pleasant gentleman who immediately started getting into their specials for the night.We wanted to start with appetizers and the Spot Prawn Ceviche special sounded good.  When it arrived however, it didn't look very appetizing, the head and even tail were removed as was the shell, but what was left behind was a strange membranous look to the shrimp.  So Ceviche is supposed to be cured in citrus so that while it is not cooked with heat, it has the texture and consistency of cooked meat.  We each garnished a shrimp with the caviar and truffle on the plate and took a bite, and each of our faces (4 of us) instantly puckered up.  Our waiter Marcin came over shortly after seeing our reactions, and immediately asked if everything was OK.  We politely explained to him it was not really what we expected, and that the flavor and texture was also....unappetizing...like getting blasted by a wave of salt water with the shrimp itself having a mealy but partially crunchy texture.  We had eaten 4 of the 6 prawns so we said we would still pay for it but Marcin insisted he would bring us something else instead, and we ordered the Lobster bisque salad, which was amazingly good!As for the rest of the meal, there were some hits and misses, so here's a quick rundown.  The sword fish special was very good, the salmon special not so much.  The namesake duck was amazing and made us regret not just getting the whole duck meal for 4.  The seared scallops and pork belly were also amazing, but a smaller portion than the person who ordered expected.   As for sides, the collared greens weren't very good, we would have gone with the mashed potatoes if we had a do-over.Desert was fine, drinks were outstanding (if not expensive as mentioned), but overall Marcin saved the night by rescuing us from the Spot Prawn Ceviche horror. :)",Jerry C.

Two nice points: they set my wife's purse on a footstool to keep it off the ground, and a busboy brought me a napkin before I asked for one (my face was covered in grease).The food was amazing, and I was introduced to a number of new types of dishes. The bone marrow is a must, with sweet and slightly salty seasoning that is delightful. I ordered duck breast and loved the way it was not too greasy or bland. It tasted like a lighter ham and was a great alternative to the usual fare.The ambience was very intimate, with marble floors and low lighting. I recommend at least business casual for dinner here.

1157,Concord,2013-03-09,EJeQdPeBW4mG5xZhKcbb9w,2, NH,"I went to the Blue Duck Tavern with high expectations, and left underwhelmed if not deflated. All I can say is well, my food tasted like they had extracted the entire dead sea into my plate and were like here enjoy! To preface I'm vegetarian with a garlic allergy, so I stuck to the veggie meals that they could accommodate to my needs. I started out with their pimms cup style drink which was delectable, if anything I'll be going back to the bar here. After being promised that I could eat the soup, it was revealed it had garlic in it, so that was a no go. Instead I ordered the sweet potato custard, which was like honestly one of the worst dishes I've tried to eat out in a long time, they served it to me twice  and both times it was a sodium laden feast I had to send back. I'm sure its not like this all the time, just last night, but it was an awful dish. I gave a tiny bite to my boyfriend and he confirmed the overly salted flavor in the dish. The waiter noted usually folks complain about the sweetness, but the salt took everything good about sweet potatoes away, and I mean come on they have sweet in in their name!  Instead I was given a green salad with a Chardonnay vinaigrette, which I had to double check that had no garlic in it since the flavors to me were worrisome, no one with an allergy wants to be worried when they're out to eat. This place made me worried. Thankfully the salad came back with a safe check, and I ate it. The greens were fresh and varied, the dressing delicate but not worth the cost of my nerves. My main course was the vegetarian risotto, which was also too extremely salty for my my taste. I ate at most half of it. At that point I didn't want to send it back, since I had already sent back two dishes, and I'm sure like the sweet potato it was really the whole batch that was problematic. The fried sage on top was the best part, and my favorite part of the first two courses...so basically I enjoyed a fried herb for dinner. YUM!Lastly we had the apple pie which was served with some complimentary ice cream, it was as good as expected, but the saving grace of the evening was the blood orange sorbet served in the ice cream mix. It was delicate, flavorful, and garlic-free :-). My boyfriend was particularly ecstatic about the glazed veal sweetbreads. He wishes he could eat them everyday.  He also ordered brussel sprouts which were overcooked and charred too much, and the roasted bone marrow, which in his opinion was just okay. All in all we walked away with a free glass of wine (for him) and some free ice cream. The service was good, albeit a bit nerve racking for a person with an allergy. I''ve had better experiences at low key places around DC where the Maitre D would come out to check on me, or even the chef, and where that has happened I've had a much more positive experience, because they seem to treat allergies and their cooking more seriously.  Honestly to me it seemed like for having such an extensive vegetarian menu, they just don't know how to do vegetarian right, and at the price we paid it was just disappointing.",Erika R.

My cousins/parents, who have never tried sweetbreads, couldn't stop eating!GET THE BRAISED BEEF RIB. You will not regret it. You will savor every single bite of that succulent, savory, tender beef that just falls off the bone.

I travel a lot and am a big foodie, so for me to be impressed (at the risk of coming across as cocky) is a fantastic feeling!In short, DELICIOUS, mouth-watering food. We decided to try many things in the menu and they just kept getting better... Chic, cosy and funky atmosphere (the place has an open-kitchen concept -beautiful). And most of all, I've never had such attentive staff. Would go back as soon as I'm back in town!!!Food we had/I would recommend: Snap pea salad, crunchy shrimp salad and bone marrow(appetizer/pre-main course); quail, shallots and grits (main course) and apple pie for dessert. You will walk out happy, I promise!",adea k.

We had bone marrow,  mussels and a charterise board. All amazing. I got the scallops and they were so fresh! The apple pie dessert is a must!! The meal was absurdly expensive. So i would only go again if it was a work trip.",Jamie K.
1164,Bethesda,2013-06-05,01zbPyA2mbnVCrGsHv9QAg,2, MD,"I had such high hopes for this restaurant based on the reviews and was certainly disappointed in virtually every dish we ordered.  The service was fine, the bread was tasty and the butter was soft but everything went down from there.We started with the Brussels Sprouts Salad and Swiss Chard & Onion Tart.  The salad had a very sour taste, almost like old coleslaw and there wasn't enough Parmesan cheese to mask the taste.  The tart was made with goat cheese to give it a sweeter flavor but was still just mediocre and was served cold so it felt like I was eating leftovers.The entrees included the Suckling Pig and the Maine Scallops along with sides of sauteed mushrooms, fries and creamy grits.  My wife ate the scallops and said she enjoyed them but wished they were a little larger in size (and there were only 3 scallops total).  The accompanying vegetables were fair.  The Suckling Pig was quite fatty and had a sauce that tasted off - perhaps too much white vinegar.  It not only made the pig unpleasant but also didn't complement the (very) bitter vegetables it came with.  My wife said the grits were okay but the Red Eye Gravy was more like balsamic vinegar.  The fries weren't anything special and, due to their large size, absorbed more oil than typical fries would (I ended up only eating 1 of them).  I am a fan of wild mushrooms but, again, the sauce gave the dish an odd flavor that was not enjoyable for either of us.For dessert, we had some of the homemade ice cream, which came with chocolate covered strawberries.  It tasted like normal, store-bought ice cream and the chocolate on the strawberries had a wafer-like texture (it felt like eating a Nestle Crunch bar with strawberries).  Overall, dessert was nothing special.Based on our experience with all the dishes here, I wouldn't go back again.",Joshua F.

What was memorable was next morning's breakfast--my rye toast was heinously undertoasted--warmed bread would be a more apt descriptive--and when I called upon the waiter to correct this travesty a manager was summoned to explain that rye does not brown and that it had been served correctly.  Funny, I was the short order cook at Forest Hills Country Club where I ran the breakfast service for a two year stretch back in the 80's and can therefore attest that rye bread will indeed brown when properly exposed to radiant heat and have enough of a science background to understand the Maillard reaction (no Maillard at The Duck ha ha) and am fairly certain that rye is subject to the laws of physics so shut the f@ck up and toast my f@cking toast you f@cking a#*holes.Also, my otherwise excellent fruit platter contained two moldy blueberries and when I pointed that out my server explained that the kitchen can't check everything and I also disagree with that statement.",Paul K.

1169,Washington,2013-03-22,sUbnNtNOS_tY9hD95zVOGA,3, DC,"The word I would use for Blue Duck is overrated. It's lovely inside, the service is great and the food is decent enough. But for the price, I should have loved my meal, and I just kind of liked it. I had also heard so many great things about this place, I was expecting something exceptional - and I really didn't think it was. However, it was very good. I started with the shaved Brussels sprouts salad with apples, walnuts and Parmesan cheese. The combination of flavors was excellent. This was definitely my favorite thing of the night. For my entree, I had the chicken, which sounded more interesting than it actually was. It was kind of dry and flavorless, but the sides were good. I had been hearing about the apple pie for months, so my friends and I shared that for dessert. Again, it was good, but no better than I've had other places. If Blue Duck wasn't so pricey, I'd come a lot more often, because I did enjoy my meal for the most part.",Diana Z.
1170,Chicago,2011-03-06,-rmSEmJ9Zcp0gDpLCZrP_w,3, IL,"Lured in by advertisements for the donut-based granola-topped french toast, and reinforced by a fond memory I had of lunch here five years ago, we made brunch reservations for a moderately special occasion and whet our appetites.  But BDT is a sufficiently fancy place that first I should say a few words about the service and the setting.  The layout, while slightly disorienting (especially if you're trying to get in from the street) is a lovely combination of modernist and homey, with huge amounts of light in the front room.  They even agreed to reseat us in a sunnier part of the restaurant after we'd started our meal elsewhere.  And in other respects the service was extremely accommodating-- they offered us extra sauce when we they saw us enthusiastically sopping it up, and clearly seemed eager to please.  The one respect, in which they repeatedly failed to please, however, was speed.  They were slow to take our first drink order, slow to take our food order after that, slow to come by when the food was done, and slow to pick up the check once we asked for it.  We were having a relatively relaxed meal, but the delays easily added up to fifteen more minutes than ideal.As for the food:  All of the dishes we had were good, but all of them were also not as excellent as they had sounded from their description.  Arugula with preserved lemon was fresh and tasty, but it's not clear what was ""preserved"" about the lemon or what that preservation added to the dish.  It was a small arugula salad with a lemony dressing, and it wasn't worth nine dollars.  The french-toast donut was still, essentially, a kind of moist donut, with a sprinkling of granola on top.  It would have been better with a crunchy crust, or if the french toast treatment had seemed to add anything to the underlying donut.  It was a good donut, but we wouldn't have been as enthusiastic about going and ordering ""good donut.""  The egg with cod cake and spicy buttermilk sauce was also less than I would have hoped.  First, it needed salt (as restaurant food so rarely does).  The cod cake wasn't that flavorful (who knew that was possible?), so the buttermilk sauce had to carry the dish.  And it was a good sauce, but not dish-carryingly good.  We did sop it up with the bread-- which had probably once been spectacular, but appeared to have spent the night in a bag, where its crust had turned from crunchy to leathery.With drinks, coffee, three dishes, and a tip, brunch was $90 for two people.  That's a lot of money, and it wasn't worth it.  They do so much right, but vision and presentation currently outpace flavor.I don't mean to sound cheap, and I do spend a lot of money on food.  But when you are going to splurge you want to really enjoy it.  Tom Friedman and the Australian Prime Minister were both here when we were; maybe we should leave them to it.",William B.

Every dish was an all star -- appetizers, mains, sides, even the cheese board. I went with my boyfriend and got the duck for my main, which was fabulous and easily could have made the meal by itself. After reading reviews before our meal we decided we also had to try the bone marrow for an appetizer, and it did not let us down -- even with the bar set very high by other Yelp reviewers. For sides, we got the crispy Brussel sprouts, and sweet potato mash -- all excellent. I got the salad with pear to start as well, it was also great -- although the pear was the only thing that really set this salad apart from many similar salad I've had before. The service was similarly excellent. Our waitress was very professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. She overheard us debating whether or not to get the sweet potato mash and after we decided not to, she later brought it out for us to try on the house. It was a very nice gesture on the part of the restaurant and the sweet potatoes were, of course, delicious. I can't wait to come back again and try some more of what this restaurant has to offer.",Sarah B.

1173,Hyde Park,2012-09-08,3ZFEAOgxhsMdKTDx-pirVQ,2, NY,"Overall a disappointing experience. I had high hopes going in, as the place was highly recommended. My braised beef shortribs were good, but were not served hot or even lukewarm...niether were any of the other 3 entrees on the table. Hot food needs to be served hot-- I realize braising is a long process, and it was probably prepped well before the dinner service, but sending out room-temp entrees is not acceptable. My main issue was the service: on both the appetizer and the dessert we ordered items that never made it to the table, but managed to still appear on the bill. At dessert, we were also brought an item we did not order, but the waiter refused to return it to the kitchen even though we did not want it. When we asked him to take it away, he told us it was good and we should just try it. Excuse me? When I mentioned that an item we ordered never came, he looked at the table as though trying to find it...didn't see it...said nothing to me, and continued to clear the table. He never brought it or acknowledged that we asked about it. Yet it was on the bill.The tab was almost $400 for 4 people, and it was not at all worth that.And everyone raves about the apple pie and calls it the best in the city? Not so much.This was a wasted evening and wasted money.",Anonymous G.

I only ate 2... it was pretty filling.  The sauce it came with wasn't my favorite, I couldn't figure out, I would have been happy with just ketchup.  Then to end the night we had a apple pie for two, which I believe could have been for 4.  It was very delicious.  The waiter checked frequently with our table and made sure our glasses of water were always full.Its a bit on the pricey side, but it is a place worth splurging.",Mary P.

We started off with two appetizers.  A butter poached spiny lobster tail and a lamb belly with hen egg.  The lobster was decent but the lamb belly was a little tough.  I wouldn't rank it up there with the best lamb belly I've had.For our entrees, the wife ordered the Wagyu Hanger Steak and I had the 12 hour Slow Roasted Suckling Pig.  Both entrees had tremendous flavor and we enjoyed them very much.  For sides, we shared the stone ground cheese grits with red bean gravy and the okra with stewed tomatoes.  I wasn't a fan of the okra and stewed tomatoes but the grits were very good.... even though they were extremely rich.The apple pie a la mode was very good.... especially the vanilla bean and honey ice cream!  Our waiter also brought out some sugar cookies for my wife for her birthday, which I assume made up for the fact that they weren't going to give her a free apple pie for her birthday.Again, overall, the food was very good.  The problem is that I wouldn't rush back immediately to eat here again.  Reservations are hard to come by here so I guess I was expecting something absolutely exceptional.  There are a select few places in both DC and Baltimore I'd rather eat, but this is a still a good place for a special occasion.",Geoff G.

1182,Guelph,2012-09-10,Dp8qePJUVQFkbiecsxK66A,4, Canada,"Breakfast is such a great meal to visit a restaurant, because you can order sweet or savoury items early in the morning.  After discovering Blue Duck about a month  before our DC trip, the innovative menu excited us.  We were both unaware that Blue Duck was located in the Park Hyatt Hotel, not a big deal, just that we felt slightly under dressed.  To start off, the service is exceptional.  To prevent your purse from sitting on the floor, they bring over a little table to rest it on, genius.  To start, we split a pot of coffee which was excellent, and after you are done with your sugar packets, they come over and collect them, so attentive.  For food i had the short rib hash with Olive Oil Poached Eggs, and Horseradish Sauce.  Now i don't want to be over critical, but the menu clearly states that the dish was to come with poached eggs, and instead they were fried.  Now i actually thought that the dish benefited from the eggs cooked in this style, but when the staff is so attentive, i was surprised with that mix up.  The meat and potatoes were cubed to a comparable size.  The meat was so delicious, tender, and flavourful, i wish though that the temperature of it was hotter.  I am normally not a horseradish fan, and i considered asking them to omit it, but i would have regretted it after because it completed the whole dish.  My sis had the jumbo lump Maryland crab with scrambled egg whites, Tomato, Baby Spinach, Avocado, Cream Cheese, Multigrain Bread.  The crab tasted so fresh, it was wonderful.  For the cream cheese element, it felt too heavy and unnecessary.  She loved the addition of the chili oil and the avocado.  After each having an entree we were full, however we noticed planks of wood with delicious looking sticky buns set on top.  The buns are described as being wood fired, so i assumed that they would be warm and gooey.  They came to the table lukewarm, and totally dried out.  Since the food level is so high, i expected these to be delicious, and fresh out of the oven.  Instead they tasted like stale buns just heated up, definitely the low point of the meal.Overall, i absolutely love the place.  The service is impeccable, the food is outstanding, and i will definitely come back on my next visit.",Amy D.

As good as it gets!"".Blue Duck Tavern is in my experience, one of the few restaurants in DC that manage to have a menu that is simple yet eclectic and  is executed near perfection. There are only 2 other restaurants that I've been too (in DC) with a higher level of execution, Proof and Tosca. Apps:Bone Marrow - Delicious fatty goodness. Was dissapointed that the dish was missing the slivers of truffle as seen in all the other pictures on yelp.Entrees:Duck Breast - this dish might singlehandedly be the best meat entree I've ever had. Comes out medium rare and is extremely tender and flavorful. I HIGHLY recommend getting this.Short Rib - Again, dissapointed that this dish did not look like as pictured in other reviews. Was not served on the bone like seen in many pictures. The meat itself was not tender for being a short rib. Not sure if the meat was overcooked but the fat seemed to have been cooked off. The majority of bites seemed to be all meat.Dessert:Some meringue covered ice cream cake - Not on the menu but was brough to me for my birthday. This was very good. Its level of sweet was right on the money.. Not too sweet but sweet enough to be a true dessert. Will come back again!",Michael S.

I don't live near the city so I try to avoid going to DC during the weekdays and since it's so busy on the weekends, i decided that my birthday would be a special event and make the trek. WELL, let me tell you I was severely UNDERWHELMED by the whole experience.Even though I had a reservation, I still had to wait an additional 15 minutes. Our waiter cared more about talking to three young blondes and chatting up french speakers than explaining to me what the seasonal specials were. The other waiter on the floor didn't even say anything to me. Not even an ""excuse my reach"" when pouring me water.  Additionally, there was a 15 minute wait between my appetizer and main course as well as additional 20 between my main course and dessert. I wasn't able to leave until 10:50 for an 8:15 reservation. Enough of the service, onto the food. To reiterate, it was just, underwhelming. I had read such rave reviews about the braised beef rib.. to my disappointment, I did not have the entertaining factor of the meat with the bone. It was already sliced off for me. Disappointing. Additionally, my husband ordered the monkfish (seasonal special) which was overcooked and dry.  The only saving grace was the bone marrow appetizer dish because even the apple pie dessert was so dry! I also heard that on birthdays they make a special dessert for you, all I received was a doggie bag of sugar cookies.  2.5 stars at best. It may have just been my luck that day, but I wouldn't come back, even for the exciting and beautiful ambiance.",Jac H.

We also got the vegetable side dish.The highlight of the night was the dessert. We ordered a cherry cheesecake. The place has an interesting take on the cheesecake - it was technically an inverted cheesecake, a round cake with the crust outside and creamy part inside.

And there I was, at the Blue Duck Tavern, one of my all time favorites in DC, unsure of what to order. Some of my old favorites have been the scallops, crab cakes and duck confit which are outstanding. The Apple Pie is one of the best I've ever had and quite frankly, so are the pizzas. The food here is seasonal and there is plenty to choose from, so vegetarians - have no fear. You will find something on the menu that works for you.The true appeal however lies in the chef's ability to prepare all American food with the kind of simplicity and almost ""homeliness"" that makes such a grand and visually stunning restaurant seem more approachable. Dining at the Blue Duck Tavern is just boozy perfection. You must go there with a hearty appetite and an open mind.

The Decor is extremely nice and modern, and the service was fantastic. So my cousin invited a couple of friends for her birthday brunch (her husband ended up paying for the entire party so that was nice). I had the grapefruit juice (free refills though i think they cap it off at a certain amount), along with the steak tavern and eggs. The eggs were great and the steak was fantastic, the was a broad range of dishes from crab fritatta, pancakes, french toast, everyone of our party of 14 enjoyed their respective meals tremendously. The only thing that i didnt like was the complimentary bread which was hard as rock,  hey its free, not enough to downgrade the whole restaurant experience. Dessert was not on the cards, until i made mention of their famous apple pie (per yelp reviews) so promptly we ordered 2 apple pies for those that still had room.

They also have an extensive non-alcoholic drink list, which I really appreciated. But the desserts are really what's worth coming from. They make their own ice cream (I had the vanilla honey and it was incredible!) and the apple pie is to die for! Overall, the experience was wonderful. The food is very good, but the dessert is really what stands out. I highly recommend every DC resident to try it at least once!",Ana B.
1192,College Park,2013-10-01,y0bGsZFkKt_twoHvrZUDGA,4, MD,"Finally got around to Blue Duck Tavern, been wanting to come here for a while but reservations on weekends are hard to come by if you don't book in advance.For starters, bone marrow and watermelon salad, both really good. As for the entrees, I thought the roasted chicken was pretty standard, the NY strip was cooked to perfection. Got the grits and mushrooms for sides, these were alright. Thank goodness my friend ordered the honey vanilla ice cream to finish off his meal, it went well with my chocolate raspberry cake, sort of toned down the sweetness so it was less overwhelming. I've heard good things about their brunch, will be going back for that soon.",Tonia W.
1193,Charlottesville,2015-05-31,7xO-VbihTFs8UqfqukTgRw,5, VA,"My wife and I had our anniversary dinner here after I booked online via opentable. I mentioned in our reservation that we were celebrating and we were presented with complimentary champagne upon sitting down, very thoughtful! I wouldn't say the atmosphere is great for a super romantic dinner as it's a bit noisy in the place and we were seated just about within arms length of others, but nonetheless it ended up working out for us and I was satisfied. They have a very extensive wine list ranging from $50 to who knows what but a lot. The food is small, sharable plates. I guess similar to tapas but way better (I hate tapas). The bone marrow is to die for, melts in your mouth. Highly recommended. We ordered one of each thing form each category on the menu and we went disappointed with any of it. For dessert we couldn't decide between 2 amazingly sounding treats so we asked or server, kamal, to surprise us. He ends up bringing us both, one on the house with happy anniversary written in chocolate around the plate. Well done, kamal!Service was excellent. Food was brought out in a timely manner and the dishes were explained to us by the staff upon presenting it to us. This was our first time at blue duck tavern and we'll definitely be back!",Davis G.

I had the brussel sprouts (I had brussel sprouts), which were crisp and flavorful, a duck dish and some fries. SO GOOD. It's a wee bit on the greasy side, which didn't deter the husbear and myself as we planned to walk back to the Mandarin Oriental, and the wine recommended by the sommelier made the dinner just boozy enough for us not to mind the long walk.

1198,Washington,2013-01-16,0QEYT_RExuIuLANst14Qsw,1, DC,So there are many things that make and break a restaurant. In this case it was the valet. But before I get to him...The food is good. The bone marrow? Ehh I'll do without that for the rest of my life.They do some good things with duck. Their fries are really tasty.And the wine selection is also very good.The reason why I'll never go back is two-fold.One is that when I came home today from work with DC metro (which deserves a rant in its own regards as an institution) I found that my car was not working...Why? Well because on Monday the wise-valet found the need to turn my automatic headlights to on and when I came home from the quite nice dinner I didn't realize that there was a change.Now if you are a valet... your job is not complicated. You might take your time to know a thing or two about cars... But of course that is too much to expect out of the workforce in DC.But the worst is when I called BDT twice tonight I was told twice that they would call me back. I didn't expect much. Maybe an apology from the valet manager or a complimentary drink but I certainly expected a call back.Apart from the time I will waste to get a jump start from my local car shop I guess I didn't lose much. But they lost a customer who was very happy with his meal when he left on Monday.,Cagri T.
1199,Arlington,2014-04-23,BiMSgmoVXgB8ppbEoS-9uA,3, VA,I went there for lunch. I had the duck leg confit and fries. The duck skin was seared perfectly but the meat was a little bit dry.  The chef's tripled fried technique made the thick fries very crunchy and flavorful. The parsley sprinkled on the fries gave it an extra layer of flavor.  I really enjoyed sitting in the outdoor area. I'm glad an upscale restaurant like the blue duck tavern has an outdoor space. Eating here was a good way to spend my work lunch break.,Richard Y.
1200,New York,2010-04-29,wNJpg3L9KyVsRl1jwOcJMQ,5, NY,"When the boy got put up at the Park Hyatt for a conference and the timing worked out such that I was also in town at the same time, it dawned on me that BDT shared the same space, so I suggested we revisit it.  Being the diligent boyfriend he is, he rang for reservations and we were easily able to score a pair of seats on a Tuesday night.More noteworthy than the space (which is striking enough), the team service setup here seems to work reasonably well.  One just needs to understand it in advance and be willing to flag down anyone standing/passing nearby and you're ensured to be taken care of efficiently and effectively.I'm not sure who's behind the cocktail program here, but they seem to know their stuff.  We opted to have the Sazerac and some sort of ginger sake-tini with Domaine de Canton.  Fortunately, the boy gravitated toward the sake concoction, while the Sazerac fit my preferred flavor profile, even if it was a little heavier on the absinthe than I anticipated.  At $14 a pop, one would expect something noteworthy from the drinks here, yet they still deliver.  And how.  I was lit after just the one.As before, the food is pretty much beyond reproach.  I won't go into much detail, other than to say that even though I have limited experience with bone marrow, I thought that the delivery of their version here was delightful.  There aren't many places I'd trust enough to even order it, but it's pretty hard to go wrong when cooking it in butter and serving it with roasted garlic and coarse salt.  Mm!  Similarly, our other dishes, the Maine scallops, the Muscovy duck breast, Swiss chard pie, and frozen cheesecake were all wonderful.  Highly recommend the duck breast, by the way - so rich and savory.BDT certainly isn't a once-a-month experience for me, but for two starters, an entree, a dessert, and two drinks, the cost per head was only $70 and we left stuffed.  Definitely a totally reasonable value for the cost.  And who doesn't dig a romantic dinner out every once in awhile, right?",Kevin L.

It's a pretty classy joint, but it's not annoyingly pretentious. The food, service, and atmosphere were all pretty snazzy. The price? Ehh, not so much. BUT (a big but, here.

1203,Chicago,2010-06-04,22VqkMCbXc7TQi84tQDuLQ,5, IL,"My culinary tour of DC began with an outstanding dinner at Blue Duck Tavern. Our hotel was close enough, so we walked. The restaurant is beautiful. We entered right next to a large fountain and they had a gorgeous outdoor patio. But, it was a really hot day so we sat inside. We were led past their open kitchen and pastry areas to our table and I made mental note of the tasty looking apple pies. The menu highlights fresh items and it proudly lists the many corners of the nation that supply them. We started with the Spinach and Frisee salad with pancetta vinaigrette and cheese curds. Fantastic. The pancetta and curds were amazing. Our entrees were Hawaiian Swordfish for the lady and Pork Chop and cheek with grainy mustard for me. We also added a side of sauteed rapini with pumpernickel croutons. That was the first time I had pork cheek and it tasted like short rib, the chop was better and the sauce was terrific (big mustard fan here). Kris loved her swordfish and made quick work of it. The rapini was great as well and those croutons were an interesting touch. Save room for dessert, because there are a lot of tempting options for you. Many home made ice creams and sorbets. We got the apple pie with a scoop of Maple Walnut ice cream. The pie was huge and we ended up taking half home. It was stuffed with sugary cinnamony apples. The ice cream was a perfect complement. Service was spot on and people were always dropping by to refill wine, water or ask how things were. They did not miss a thing.",Dan G.

1209,Woodside,2010-04-19,Oc5jff6PbMzzq45Xat7JjQ,5, CA,Blue Duck Tavern was an an AMAZING brunch! It was not cheap (at about $70 for the two of us) but we left full and SATISFIED!I started with a yummy latte ($6) to drink and my dining date had the Chesapeake Bloody Mary ($12) that included clamata juice and yummy spices around the rim. We both ate some of the bread and very yummy bread that came out before we ordered.Our waitress was friendly and helpful and there were a lot of waitresses/waiters/helpers bustling around the restaurant in formal suits.We shared the crab omelet ($20) and added spinach which was a perfect addition and the short rib hash (about $18). Both dishes were amazing and the biscuit and special sauce that came with the short rib hash were to-die-for! I literally ate little pieces of biscuit off the table because I could not bear to part with any little piece of its amazingness... We also shared the special veggie side which was broccoli rabe in butter and garlic ($9). Everything about our meal was done just-right and I would LOVE to come back to the Blue Duck Tavern!,Meghan P.

1211,Westwood,2016-12-16,3OPSYAPRrRU9QbhMmfTeyA,4, NJ,"We stopped in for dinner and were a little surprised at the arrangement. We diid not have reservations and were told its open seating. 3 of us (wife, daughter and I) did not want to sit with other people so we waited for a table about an hour. We were good with that and hung at the bar. Bar is tiny, but Rob the bartender was great and the folks at the bar were friendly and we had good conversations with all at the bar. Drinks were good (great martini- super cold), but a little pricey. 2 martinis and a vodka tonic was 60. We sat down for dinner and service was good. We skipped appetizers and went right to dinner. We had a prime strip steak, a Ribeye for 2 and brussle sprouts. All were very good and we would order again. For dessert we had the apple pie, which is overated and bland. As far as service it was great at first, but once we sat and ordered our dinner it went down hill. We didnt see our waiter after ordering our dinner for a good hour, and by that time the restaurant was quiet. Overall a very good meal, service great at bar, and ok at tables. Pricing was pretty steep for the meal and service. I would go back, but try other places as well.",Sean S.

It did lack the grilled flavor of a steak (because braised), so don't get it if that's what you are looking for. The steak sauce was very tasty. The suckling pig was also very tender and had an excellent crust. It was not too fatty like some tender pork can sometimes be. The apple pie had a great crunchy sugary top crust. The apples were not too sweet and were good. The vanilla ice cream tasted fresh, but was a little watery. The violet ice cream was very tangy and very tasty. The mocha was a very rich with mocha and coffee taste and was very good. Overall a solid 4 stars.",Jeff H.

I don't remember exactly what I ate, but I remember my meal came with a ""biscuit"" (that was really more like a croissant or some sort of biscuit croissant hybrid) that was UNBELIEVABLY good. I still think about it, and this was years ago.I've come for both dinner and drinks countless times since. I love every part of the restaurant: the open kitchen, the outdoor seating, the bar/lounge area. The design/decor looks so good. The bar area has a slightly different menu, but I often prefer to sit there because the bar menu has bone marrow on it, which the dinner menu does not. The bone marrow is great, I would definitely recommend it. Their short ribs are also some of the best I have had.DEFINITELY order ice cream. They make all of their ice creams and sorbets in house, and the flavors change from time to time, but they are soooo good. They also have a really good goat milk caramel.

The duck was done right, skin was crispy, meat was tender and juicy, and very flavorful. Cleaned the plate! Some pieces were a bit medium which was a little gross, but after adding the pumkin relish, it was ok. The leg confit was a bit on the dry side, but still good.The bf ordered the 12 Hour Roasted Suckling Pig (Baby vegetables, pork jus) - it was good, but it didn't wow me like my duck breast.

1223,Washington,2010-03-19,QW5D4eP6ZXJQbDzhdA35rA,5, DC,"Blue Duck gets my vote as best hotel restaurant in DC.  Note: I don't generally like hotel restaurants, but this is definitely an exception.  Chef McBride is consistently good and from all accounts, treats his staff very well (a lot of chefs are screamers, he is not).  Unlike some hotels (Ritz Carlton, the W, Four seasons, Mandarin Oriental, Latham), they did not have to lure an out of town name; McBride has been working at this Hyatt for years.The ambiance is upscale, but not stuffy, and the food is seasonal American cooking.  I like to hit it up at off hours (weekends between lunch and dinner or late in the evening at the bar).  Speaking of the the bar (a square island off to the side of the main dining room), the 2005 Maramonte Syrage (a California blend) I had here was a revelation; inexpensive, but one of my favorite American bottles of all time.Their shtick here, if want to call it that, is the word burning oven.  I'm a big fan of these as they impart a nice smokey taste (just compare a pizza from a wood-burning oven with one from a convection oven and you'll notice the difference immediately).  As I said, the menu is seasonal, so the entrees change, but whatever you do, make sure you have some of sides.  The chef some amazing things with vegetables; if there's anything with chanterelles on the menu, get it.  He also has a way with game and the menu has featured quail, venison, pheasant and duck; stick with anyone of those and you won't be sorry.",Christopher C.

Kate works in the restaurant industry, so I knew I needed to be extremely careful about my choice. Once inside the intimidatingly tall, welcome-to-Oz doors of the Blue Duck Tavern, I knew I had made the right decision.BDT is the kind of place that wraps its arms around you and doesn't let go until you leave -- even then, the scent of perfumed bathroom soap and hint of cinnamon from the apple pie you ordered will stay with you hours after you leave its hushed, gleaming rooms. It was 8:30 when we sat ourselves near the bar to have a couple drinks, and past 11 when we left. Neither of us noticed the time passing, because:- Our server was so smooth. Her timing was impeccable; she knew exactly when to ask if we needed anything, or make a recommendation, but otherwise she was invisible.- Kate stopped a passing chef to chat about the restaurant, and he turned out to be Brian McBride. He gave us a full tour of the kitchen and dessert stations, including a stop at a glass case full of thousand-dollar teas. When asked what pastry we absolutely had to order, he told us we needed to try the apple pie.- The apple pie was a gorgeous mix of golden crust, firm, rich apples and just a hint of sugar and spice.

1235,Boston,2012-08-23,1_cYLbi66BDwuUO-0IrH6g,4, MA,"I kind of stumbled across this place (online) and got reservations mainly because it was across the street from the hotel I was staying in for a weekend in DC.  Must say I was happy I did.This meal was quite a ways back, but still stands out for a couple reasons.  Their marrow is some of, if not the, best I have ever had.  Service was exceptional and I like the plating for some of the dishes in metal tub-like things.  Rustic yet upscale.  The open kitchen concept and table spacing were great - all too often in my native Philly you are squeezed into a smallish room and conversation suffers.  All in all a great meal.Only negatives were that things seem to be a bit pricey vs what I'm used to even for an upscale hotel restaurant (could very well just be a DC vs Philly thing) and I know I'll be ridiculed but the apple pie was, while very good, nothing exceptional.  I was expecting exceptional.  It was a big sucker though.",Brian M.
1236,Los Angeles,2012-05-03,zkJGgK0M1RBSHT_eZH2Mug,2, CA,"Blue Duck has been my favorite restaurant in the district for 3 years now. I have told countless people about the amazing food and have brought at least 2 dozen to the restaurant personally. Unfortunately the love affair is over.Booked a table for 10 [all 10 of us are chefs] and for weeks I convinced my friends the meal would be amazing.So down to business. I have a pretty set menu I like to stick to. Bone Marrow, Beef Rib and BDT Fries with either a seasonal crumble or the apple pie. It's simple, but it has never let me down before and usually for a week before I get there I am already thinking about the meal.This experience?Bone Marrow: Arrived with four pieces, but each one was shallow and half the length of the bone. Completely taken aback, they raised the price, and give you way less. Beef Rib: Oh no. This is where we definitely came off the rails. The meat is NOTHING like any of the pictures on Yelp anymore. I talked to the Restaurant Manager and they have swapped out the cut permanently. It's now a cross cut, so you see three small bones and it's attached. The problems with this were A: less meat, and B: LOTS of fat/connective tissue and C: Again the price went up and the quality went down. When we were ordering I told my friends this was a must have so 8/10 of us ordered the beef rib and when it arrived I was mortified [most of my friends ended up picking at the meat and pulling pieces away from the fat]. They replaced mine twice because as I was eating it there was a pile of fat growing on my plate and the third time it came out looking more familiar in the cube form. That being said, the servers were [and have ALWAYS been] amazing and accommodating. I could not speak more highly about the service in this restaurant.BDT Fries: Amazing, as always. I will miss these fries more than I care to put into words on Yelp.Apple Pie: Same sentiments as the Fries.Overall, the fries and pie were amazing as always. I had another reservation three weeks later for 10 with family for my husbands birthday. I called to cancel the reservation [90$/pp to be let down, no thanks] and spoke to someone who asked why I was canceling. I told him I just couldn't risk more issues for such an important meal with out of town family. He said he would pass the word to Sebastian [the executive chef] an not to cancel yet and to let Sebastian give me a call. I understood and waited three days, but no call from Sebastian. Hey, he is the chef there, far be it for me to tell him how to react/reach out to customers. But for me? I'll be taking my recommendations and business elsewhere. I called to cancel, when the hostess asked why [I hadn't mentioned any of the previous discussions to them] and I just mentioned I was waiting on a call that didn't come and when she offered to tell the chef again I told her it wasn't necessary and not to disturb him.Thanks for the wonderful previous memories Blue Duck. Sorry, but I won't be back and now my go to recommendations are going to be for 1789 [where we will be dining for my husband's birthday] and Bourbon Steak.PS I uploaded a picture of how the beef rib looks now. So take a look if you are thinking of ordering.",Sabrina L.
1237,Washington,2013-06-11,uZSjNVr72pMYhz-epVLloQ,4, DC,"A great meal in DC. Course by course:Appetizers: Bone Marrow and Foie Gras. Both were pretty incredible, but the bone marrow is amongst the best things I've tasted in the last year. Entrees: I got the braised beef and my buddy got the Wagyu beef. The braised beef was good, but not out of this world. The Wagyu was out of this world delicious, and I was very jealous. Sides: Grits and Asparagus. Grits were perfect--creamy and the red eye gravy had a punch to it. The Asparagus was meh, a little undercooked. The only stinker of the night.Dessert: We had read raves about the apple pie, so we got it, with an ice cream side. The apple pie was good, for sure, but maybe there's only so good you can make apple pie. I wouldn't get it a second time.Drinks: Got a solid sazerac. Other: The ambience in the restaurant is wonderful, open, and inviting. There is an open kitchen, which you can walk through. As we were walking out, we saw some mini-chocolate mousse (s?). When it was evident that we were staring at them, the offered them up for free. Nice touch, blue duck.",David G.

1239,Berkeley,2012-05-02,0gpgKv7LG44X0CPx5y23mQ,4, CA,"I had dinner at the Tavern a few nights ago with my friend B.G.  Because this restaurant was recommended by yelpers, i decided to check it out.  On the morning of our reservation, I popped in to case the venue.  The restaurant is visually stunning.  As you probably know from other reviews, there is a gorgeous open kitchen that dominates the dining room.  I chose a table adjacent to the kitchen and glanced over the wine list.  There are a few bottles under $60, but the wines are pretty expensive.  Bottles in the high two digits would have to be described as mid-priced.When we showed up for dinner, we chose a $94 pinot noir from the Willamette Valley; it was the 2009 Cristom, Mt. Jefferson Cuvee.  This choice was made only after a long discussion with our server, a young man from Galicia who seemed to be genuinely passionate about the food and the wine on the menu.  The wine was very good, but I've certainly had better pinot noir in my life (in situations where I paid a lot less for it!).  It's fair to say that the pinot was a fine accompaniment to our food but that it didn't play a starring role in the dinner.  (It did play a starring role when we got the check.)  Here are the winery notes on this wine: ""Medium ruby color. The 2009 Mt Jeff is as fulgent as the lighthouse at Yaquina Head on the Oregon Coast--radiant--bright and instantly appealing. This 16th edition of our Cristom flagship wine is already showing the sweet-raspberry and cinammon-spices that are its hallmark. We noted savory elements on the palate, like Matsutake mushroom, rare beef and forest floor. Don't be afraid to give it a year or two in your cellar or try it tonight with some fire-grilled Kookoolan Farms lamb chops or quail grilled on a rosemary skewer.""  I'd never before seen a wine described as ""fulgent.""We then selected two appetizers, two main dishes and one side dish: the Creamy Stone Ground Grits with Smoked Gouda, Red-Eye Gravy.  The grits themselves were the famed grits from Anson Mills, SC; you can see that the restaurant reaches for high-end ingredients.  When our main dishes came out, the house threw in a complimentary side order of sautéed wild mushrooms.  Both the grits and the mushrooms were complete knock-outs.Our appetizers were the over-roasted bone marrow and the crispy fried veal sweetbreads.  These were each A+ items.  For the main courses, we went for the 12-hour roast suckling pig and the Muscovy duck breast.  Again, simply superb!We finished our dinner with espressos and were offered complimentary chocolate-covered cookies of some kind.The food that we ate was very rich, and also very salty.  The portions were of reasonable size -- we didn't feel ripped off and didn't feel that we were over-eating.  The price of the dinner for the two of us was $260 after tax and tip.  A similar dinner would have cost a bit less in San Francisco and a lot less in Berkeley.  Washington is Washington, and I presume that the meal was fairly priced for this city.",Kenneth R.
1240,Washington,2012-06-14,kMCVZptdl-ot1MPMTieUqw,3, DC,"I really wanted to like this place because of all the great reviews but it was just ok for me.  The place was kind of hard to find if you didn't know it was in the Park Hyatt Hotel.  I drove around couple of times before I realized it was in the hotel.  The restaurant is actually quite nice.  It's dim and we had a table in a private corner.  I guess because we had sort of a big party, we were separated from everyone else.  Service was ok as well.  We had two servers and they kind of took forever to take our orders.  It didn't take too long for the food to come out.  While one of my friends was still eating, the waiter started clearing the plates and took her food.  He looked surprised when she mentioned she was still eating.  The other incident was getting change.  It literally took 20 minutes.  Whoever was getting the change was no where to be found.  The dinner took way longer than it should have.  We were there from 9 to past 12.Here's a quick run down of what we ordered and what the group thought of the food.Appetizers:Spinach and Smoke Ricotta Tart - Tart was pretty heavy but good flavors.  Spinach salad was yummy.Roasted Bone Marrow - Most of us enjoyed this.Seared Foie Gras - Everyone loved this!Wedge Salad - We thought it was kind of bland. Entrees:Market Fish - Forgot what the fish was called.  It was quite small but very good and well seasoned.Scallops - My favorite.  Very sweet and cooked perfectly.There were a couple meat dishes which I don't remember but my friends said it was just alright.Sides:Mushrooms - Super salty...I liked but most of my friends did not.Grits - Nicely seasoned, very heavy.  Spinach - Super salty as well and wasn't a big hit.Dessert:Banana S'mores - I thought it was good but my friends did not.Lemon Tart - Decent, nothing that special.Strawberry Shortbread(?) - Nothing special either.Peach Sorbet - The restaurant gave this to us and it was pretty good, but it is just sorbet.I'm a huge dessert person and would have given them one more star if the desserts had blown me away.  Service definitely could have been better since we had two servers.",Ellen V.

1245,San Diego,2016-11-08,GP5K2TPSW2w-0RgtMCjkxw,1, CA,"Four of us dined at Blue Duck on Sunday for brunch. We were extremely disappointed in the quality of the food and the service. Our lunch for four was $238 with tax. We expected a hefty bill--but we expected exceptional food, too. We started with the pecan buns. They were tasty and warm. The bun part was nice and soft--a little light on the cinnamon, but good. Two of us ordered the chicken biscuit ($22 each). First word ""chicken;"" second word, ""biscuit."" It should more aptly have been called a chicken and biscuit bottom (I mean the thinnest of bottoms--just the very bottom that sticks to the pan). No tops were included--isn't that the point of a chicken biscuit? Sadly, the biscuit was the best part of the dish. The chicken was a thigh part, with skin and sinew. I understand that many people think the thigh has more flavor. That's often true in a curry or other seasoned dish where the meat has cooked slowly for a long time. Not so on a biscuit. The skin, still attached, was fatty and slimy, and the chicken simply wasn't appetizing. One of us ordered the short rib hash (which, btw, included a full, fluffy biscuit). It was good, but overly salty. One of us ordered an omelet with rye toast. It looked unappetizing and apparently wasn't much to write home about. It was small for $18 and simply un-glorious. The server forgot the toast, which once it was served, obviously was not in-house made. It looked and tasted like food service rye. We also ordered the corn grits ($9 each). They were very good. Three of us at the table expressed interest in them, so we ordered 3 orders. Do you think the server could have informed us that they were large enough to share? All four of us ate them and there were two dishes left. One would have been enough. Three of us had Bloody Marys (very good). One of us had champagne--Louis Roderer--nice glass. We have eaten at Michelin rated restaurants--this just shouldn't be one of them.",Beth B.
1246,Singapore,2012-05-12,bswktkxTqTFdhg8uvcuWWw,5, Singapore,"On our recent visit for the 3C's in DC (Crabcakes, Cherry Blossoms and Chili Dogs), Blue Duck Tavern kept coming up as a restaurant we should check out.  We managed to score last minute reservations for brunch and popped over to West End for a truly enjoyable upscale start to another wonderful day in DC.We were surprised to find Blue Duck Tavern far more ""Gramercy Tavern"" than a tavern with wenches and pints.  The restaurant is extremely upscale, yet still perfectly comfortable.  We were glad we didn't roll up in sweats!Per the suggestions of some my fabulous fellow Yelpers, we requested to sit in the glass bar area and were shown to a large picnic table in a glass room.  The main area is a bit more homey and crowded, and we loved out table!The staff were attentive and helpful, very happy to make suggestions.We quickly settled on our orders so we could tuck into the delicious fresh bread and creamy butter:1. Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes with Mustard Sauce ($30 for 2 cakes) - While these were by a fair margin the most expensive crab cakes we sampled in DC, they were probably the freshest!  The crab cake was medium sized and full of sweet and tender chunks of crab served in a pretty copper dish with lots of micro-greens for garnish.  Very delicious and a worthwhile indulgence!2. Short Rib Hash ($19) - I'm not sure I would have ordered this without our waitress' suggestion, but I'm definitely glad I got them!  Delicious with plenty of tender cubes of short ribs!  Nice mild creamy horseradish sauce on the side3. Sunnyside Eggs with Cod Cakes ($18) - Served with a tasty spicy buttermilk sauce, these were vaguely Portugese in flavor and delicious.  I'd recommend sharing this and another entree with someone as there is A LOT of cod!  Must like Portguese style cod to enjoy!4. Hand Cut BDT Triple Fries ($10) - Amazing fries!  Jenga-block-sized potatoes, fried in duck fat until super crispy on the outside while still creamy on the inside, served with garlic mayo!  AWESOME!5. Apple Pie ($9) - Delicious with fresh apples and an addictingly sugar-crunchy, buttery crust.  Definitely get it with a scoop of honey vanilla ice cream!As you can probably tell, our entire meal was delicious!  On our way out, it was really difficult not to sneak into the open kitchen and eat some extra pies!PARTING THOUGHT: Based on menu pricing, if you are on the fence (or on a budget), brunch is a great way to try out this fantastic, upscale restaurant!",Ida C.

The fries were probably the most disappointing part of the meal.  None of us were all that impressed.We ended by sharing the apple pie with honey vanilla ice cream.  Another item I insisted on because of the Yelp reviews.  Wow.  I'm an apple pie snob and could take or leave ice cream in general, but wow.  Get the apple pie (and if the Shaker Lemon Pie/Tart is on the menu, get that too.  I had it on my earlier brunch visit and was like 2 year old with a new toy...no sharing!).  The service was very attentive and I loved watching the kitchen work.  While it's a little pricey, it's worth every penny.  I can't wait to visit again.",J K.

1262,New York,2014-04-16,fy1EddUhaIGcRwCeYcAocg,2, NY,"A friend and I made a reservation for Blue Duck a day prior and we were forced to take a 1:45PM recitation. If you would like to eat during more suitable brunch hours, I would suggest making a reservation a little more in advanced. I would definitely never go here without a reservation though. Despite having arrived on time, we were not seated until about 10 minutes later. They even allowed others without a reservation to sit before us. On top of that, walking through the restaurant, we noticed that most of the tables were empty, so I feel like they were just being inefficient. My friend and I ordered the breakfast sandwich with the lamb sausage, short ribs hash, a side of the hash browns, and pecan sticky buns as a starter. The sticky buns came out in a timely manner. They were warm and sweet and the pecans are completely avoidable in any case you don't like pecans. Despite having a pretty generous carmel topping, the buns were not too sweet in the slightest. They would be great as a starter or as a dessert. Based on the one bite I had of the breakfast sandwich, I thoroughly enjoyed the lamb sausage, but everything else was meh. Keep in mind, however, that my friend believed the lamb to be too salty. My biggest complaint was on my entree, the short rib hash. I was so excited about this hash and the waiter hyped it up and ensured me it is one of the most well-known dishes they serve, so naturally my expectations were high. When I received it, it came with a biscuit that I felt like should have been more warm and soft in the center, but instead it had a pretty thick crunchy exterior shell. At the first bite, I was mind-blown by the hash. The short ribs are slowly cooked in marinade for 12 hours, so they were extremely tender and flavorful. Unfortunately, there is such a thing as too flavorful. The combination of the rich, tender short ribs, the yolk of the over-easy egg, the marinade, combined with the shortage of hash, did not offset the intense flavor of the other items. At first impression, I felt a bit scammed by the small amount of food I was getting compared to the hefty price, but by the end, I could not even finish the dish. I was thoroughly disappointed by the almost inedible entree. The hash browns were also meh. The herbs attempted to make it unique and more flavorful, but the at the end of the day, it tasted like normal hash browns to me. Would I ever come back? Probably not. The service and the food were both sub-par for the expensive price point.",Emily C.
1263,Alexandria,2014-08-22,CVKXHr84lxWEanDEWjDA-A,2, VA,"I wanted so badly to love this place, and had anticipated our dinner for months.  Unfortunately, my boyfriend and I both left underwhelmed, and seriously disappointed.   The bone marrow is probably the only reason my review earned 2, instead of 1 stars.  It was good..overly salty, but a solid appetizer. We also ordered the eggplant appetizer which was akin to a mix between baba ghanoush and hummus.  Again, this dish was over salted, and the flavor was fine, nothing spectacular. For the main course I ordered swordfish, which came out in an odd presentation and left much to be desired.  Aside from the smokiness, there was little flavor.  I wish some of the salt from the appetizers had been applied to my main entree.  The corn and bean accompaniment was fine, but nothing to write home about- certainly not what I had hoped from Blue Duck Tavern.  Unsatisfied, I figured I could at least rely on the apple pie to satisfy my sweet tooth and make up for the other inadequacies.  I had seen a number of pictures and reviews in Yelp that made mention to their amazing apple pie.  What we got was scalding hot on the top, and freezing cold on the inside. The crust tasted old, and the apples were far from crisp.  The ice cream was fantastic, but did not come close to making up for the $12 price.  An additional complaint: the lower level was fairly empty and a couple was seated directly next to us when there were spaces a few tables away that could have avoided the awkwardness, and having to talk over them.

I kept putting off the review because whatever I write it won't be good enough. This is one of my top 5 restaurants, and I have traveled globally and had some fantastic meals.

1265,Chicago,2012-04-24,kMyhOo6ooTXKkmb3GH-VbQ,4, IL,"Order the hand-cut fries here.  These are probably the best fries I've ever had in my life, and that's really saying something because I've yet to meet a fry I didn't like.  We ordered the mushrooms & the collard greens on the recommendation of the server, and the mushrooms were nice, but the collard greens were not; they had some kind of weird cinnamon-y sweet spice that was just gross.  Actually sent them back in exchange for the asparagus, which was okay, thought it definitely could have been warmer. We also ordered the bone marrow (which is excellent--though why only 3 pieces of toasted bread, Blue Duck?  3 or 4 small pieces = insufficient bread.) & the beef rib which was quite good.  The sauce is a little salty, so try to get the unsauced or lightly sauced bits, and save the rest for your date. :)Like all of the other Yelpers reviewing, I really enjoyed the open kitchen concept; it's pretty awesome to see your meal go from the professional kitchen right to your table.  If you make reservations try to get seated near one of the open kitchen stations; I believe chefs tables are available for parties of 10-12.Also tried the apple pie, which is pretty huge.  It's really good, but I wish it was warm.  I asked for just 1 scoop of ice cream (not the usual 3), which had a nice flavor, but there were little frozen bits of ice in it, and the texture wasn't too great.  Excellent service, here.  Really really excellent.  Also, the iced tea is nice.",AJ T.

1269,Washington D.C.,2012-05-02,pZT67X4mRCYv2SgkTdXcWg,5, DC,"My husband and I came here to celebrate our first anniversary - and we left happy, full, and toting home enough leftovers to feed a small army. This was my first time at a restaurant with such high caliber service. The whole experience felt posh and luxurious, but with a much lower price tag than either of us expected. Don't get me wrong - this is an expensive restaurant. But for the quality of food, service, and ambience - it is a total steal.We started at the bar, for some pre dinner drinks. My husband was pleased with the beer list and I was delighted to see so many Virginia wines (What can I say? home-state pride!) - but couldn't resist ordering a cocktail. I can be a bit of a Goldilocks when it comes to mixed drinks... nothing too sweet or too high-octane, but their 'Spicy Concoction' was right on the money. The gorgeous coral pink color was so festive, and the combination of gin, raspberry, basil, and a little bit of heat was positively sublime. Onto dinner - where we shared the spinach and smoked ricotta tart as an appetizer. Of all the many delicious items that we ate here, this was my favorite. The combination of flavors was terrific - smoky, creamy, citrusy - it was complex and decadent tasting. For his entree, my husband had the roasted suckling pig, which came topped with spicy cracklings, and some of their well-known french fries. He described the fries as being rich and intensely savory with a fluffy, mashed potato interior. He couldn't decide if he preferred dipping them in their accompanying garlicky mayo or the ""pig juice"" from his entree.I had the (perfectly cooked) grilled asparagus topped with eggs and garlic. Between the appetizer, the veggies, and my desire to save some room for dessert, I could only squeeze in a few bites of my beautiful green risotto. The fresh, slightly crisp springtime vegetables were outstanding in that buttery risotto.For dessert, my husband had the milk chocolate banana s'mores and loved it. I had the apple pie, suggested by our delightful waiter, who also brought us a mini vat of honey vanilla ice cream to enjoy with our desserts (on the house!) The apple pie is so enormous that I ended up bringing  of it home. There's a reason why people rave about this pie - the long flake crust tastes like a pie crust/ puff pastry hybrid, and the apple filling is meltingly tender and warmly spiced. And this ice cream... it was so dense and creamy that it tasted like frozen creme brulee. Our meal here was exceptional, and I left with a major restaurant crush on this place!",Erica B.
1270,Los Angeles,2014-12-20,6iQIj5tl8lLAlSkYMT9saw,5, CA,Great restaurant! We stayed at the hotel and checked this place out. Got crab cake for appetizer and it was amazing! Braised short rib for the entree was also off the hook. Definitely will be back if I go back to visit.,Aom K.

An overall delicious and easy dinner.",Stephanie S.
1272,Falls Church,2012-05-01,7mNkCIV6G2WgP73sZjvbYg,4, VA,"Blue Duck is no stranger to the locally-sourced, organic bandwagon that most fine-dining restaurants are jumping onto, and there is nothing wrong with that.Making reservations were tough, seems like the place is very popular amongst DC diners so be sure to plan something out a few weeks in advance. They do have valet at front, for a few bucks which is nice.The ambiance is modern, the dining area swathed in dark hues and chich decor with mindfully placed paintings, wall furnishings, etc. A great date choice, but there are also some areas cordoned off for larger parties as well.A nice touch to the menu is a listing of where the chef sourced their produce for each dish for that day. Some odd ones include ""Earth and Eats, PA"" and ""Eco-Friendly"" VA. Where the hell is Eco-Friendly VA? Whatever, the food is good.I went with the Bone Marrow appetizer, and they are generous: four half-slices of 5 inch bone on a bed of rock salt. I went with the Suckling Pig entree and the girlfriend ordered the Chicken and Lobster Tail. The pork dish was solid, a little oversalted but the carefully prepared vegetables actually balance that out. The chicken was one of the softest, and most tender morsels of chicken I have ever had; the lobster, however, was a little tougher from what I remembered but definitely memorable. This isn't Red Lobster's $14 dish.Their desserts are heaping, so order accordingly. Between the both of us we could only take care of one which was hands-down the highlight of the meal: sour cream cheesecake. Tastes much, much better than the name.Overall, great experience to celebrate a birthday - the waiter was engaging towards the end, pretty funny, and also lit a candle on the dessert to make things nice. Would definitely recommend.",Edwin Y.

The duck had a strange taste and the fat was not rendered all the way. They did offer my wife another entree and she opted for the braised short rib which was better than the duck but that ain't saying much. The BDT fries and side mixed greens salad wasn't worth the money. Their famous apple pie wasn't all that either. After dropping about $160, my wife and I agreed this place is overrated and just not worth the money. Give me excellent food over superb service any day of the week.

I also ordered the ridiculously-priced fruit plate ($14), which did have a good variety of fresh fruit and a lot of it, so I can't complain.The second time, I got an omelette with mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, and goat cheese. This also came with 2 slices of wheat toast AND this really good hash brown cake thing. The omelette literally left a puddle of butter on the plate when I was done, which is probably why it tasted so exceptionally delicious.

My mom called the event planner, Marvina to inquire about a group dinner for my sisters 30th birthday. She called twice leaving a voicemail each time and did not get a call back. She then called the main number and the host said ""oh I can make her answer the phone."" I'm sorry ""make"" her?! Why isn't she answering or returning messages to begin with? You'd think she'd jump at the chance to have a private event come into the restaurant! She finally answers and says ""I got your message this morning"" when my mom had left a voicemail FOUR days ago and then says ""oh we're totally booked that day."" On a Sunday?! Doubt it! Now if I were the owner of this restaurant I'd be ticked my event planner wasn't doing her job.  Phone calls should be returned within 24 hours, booked (cough cough) or not. Large party = $!

But it is not clear that it all works. For example, we had difficulty entering the restaurant - we could not pull open the very heavy very tall door(!) - I got lost while finding the bathroom!The charcuterie (shared), and roasted suckling pig ordered by my friend were excellent. My selection of a crab cake and our side of wild mushrooms was meh. We had an excellent 2009 Premier Cru Bordeaux priced at a very reasonable $75.

Our waitress spent a good five minutes to walk us through the menu to explain the farm to table concept. Everything sounded phenomenal.We had the lavender lemonade to drink, which was outstanding. So fragrant and delicious. (Which it should be for $8 a glass)I had the pork chop which was served sliced and was moist and delicious, as were the sides that came with it. Only reservation here was that half of my entree was fat, which meant there were only about 10 bites of edible meat max. Kinda disappointing for nearly $30. My partner had the chicken which was equally as succulent and delicious, but again the portion size was not enough to fully satisfy.Their signature fries are heavenly, however. Fried in duck fat, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Perfect. Their ice cream was also delicious.

I ordered the duck breast. I was disappointed that the duck skin was not very crisp. The blueberry flavor was nice, but something was off with the way the duck was cooked. The unfortunate table next to us ordered the whole duck. It was served (then sent back) burnt like charcoal.

Magically the bread that comes with the dish is cut just marginally smaller than the bone's diameter so it becomes a perfect marrow scooping tool!This is what we had:Both of us started with: Daily Harvest Vegetable and Grits without the Benton's Bacon RavigoteThe vegetable dish had a very light sauce that made it delicious while the grits got my grits-loving lady's nod of approval!Drinks: Sparkling waterFor her: Cucumber and fruit that was sweet and tangyFor me: Chocolate and rum cocktail; very heavy on the rum!Both of us: Roasted Beet Salad (w/ Endive, Apples, Walnuts,  Humboldt Fog Goat Cheese) MMm the beets were roasted to the perfection with great warm serving temperature and the combination of endives and apples with walnuts made the salad very refreshing.Wine by the bottle: A sparkling thibaut - Janisson, Blanc de Blancs, Monticello, Virginia. I asked the waiter what paired well with our selections and his recommendation was solid.Just me: Oven Roasted Bone Marrow  -- you already know how I feel about this dish; just be careful on how many sea salt baubles you put in your marrow; they are very strong. Entree for her: Roasted Swordfish Loin (with Charred Eggplant Puree,   Green Chick Peas, Oregano)Judging by the rate my lovely lady consumed the dish and her exclamation on how tasty the dish was I would imagine it was good; and its not easy to cook a swordfish.Entree for me: Braised Beef Rib (with House Made Steak Sauce) My friend told me on facebook I had to try this dish; plus I knew this was a restaurant favorite much like Ceiba's Roasted Pork Shank; so I had to get it. So this dish came from Kansas much like the bone marrow did -- the meat was so tender it just fell apart from the slightest pressure of the knife. The steak sauce was good but if only used in moderation, giving it a strong flavor. Alternating between using the sauce and not is probably the best bet.Dessert: OH MY Probably the highlight of the entire night!I knew their Apple Pie was famed; so I ordered that à la mode with Honey Vanilla Ice Cream. Guess what? The ice cream came in a huge glass bucket with a equally large spatula to serve it with, making it so fun to scoop the delicious ice cream out.The apple pie was a circular pastry from heaven; crispy hot on the outside and warm and savory with full of apple-ness fused into perfectly baked apple pieces on the inside; the melody of the honey vanilla ice cream with the pie was just unreal.Pairing each bite with sips of Café Latte for me and a Hot Chocolate for her just tipped it to another level. The host even gave us free Caramel Sauce to try as well; but my lady's choice of Pineapple Confit sauce was just so much better.Believe the hype about this place; it delivers. I will definitely be back to try their other entrees; like the Wood Burning Oven Roasted Maine Scallops!",John J.

1306,Santa Monica,2010-01-22,170otc-2puCA2QIQIj4jWA,3, CA,"3.5 stars.I really like the decor - modern, but relaxing and bright during the day. We went for brunch. Several of us ordered the sourdough pancake with dried cherries and clotted cream. The pancake comes in the cast iron pan it's made in - pretty plating with that. But, given the amount of sourdough in this one thick piece, it really needs more dried cherries. I was mostly eating pancake. The clotted cream didn't do much either; granted, it's not as rich as butter but I really relied on the syrup to do the trick. Also tried the rib hash with olive oil poached egg. The hash was too salty for me (and the person who ordered it), but it was flavorful...if you also enjoy tasting fatty pieces of meat. It was a small dish, too, probably a big fistful. The roasted vegetables we ordered as a side was great though; celery root that tasted like potatoes, cooked with bacon. Again, a heavy dish, if you like that sort of brunch. ""Homemade"" croissants and jam included four croissants and fig, honey, clotted cream, and marmalade. The jams were great, the croissants warm. By the way, what makes a restaurant item ""homemade""? Isn't everything else on the menu expectedly made at a restaurant like this? Well, calling it ""homemade"" wasn't what made us order it, but it was perhaps my favorite dish on the table. Kudos though to the service. They were great and didn't rush us, cleared our table when we needed it, and routinely filled our glasses. I'd give them .5 star for that.",Jean L.
1307,Washington,2013-10-10,mnGUcN8tG9gEHrcug7wjiQ,2, DC,"So sad by how this restaurant has gone down hill... A recap of our disastrous brunch:My cousin ordered the waffles and fried chicken. Waffles came out light and fluffy. She cut the first piece of chicken and it was a little pink inside, which we both decided was not too bad. Then she cut the chicken closer to the bone and the juice was running bloody red. We both agreed it needed to be cooked further but we couldn't find our waitress. We flagged down the passing hostess and asked her for our waitress. She clearly did not pass the message along because the waitress did not come around any time soon. Finally, our waitress stopped by and we told her (nicely) that the chicken was undercooked. She took the plate and asked my cousin if she wanted a replacement -- uh, considering that she barely ate any of the chicken because it wasn't cooked -- YES. A long time later (guess we were being punished for sending food back) the waitress comes back with a new plate of the chicken. It was perfect - crispy outside, juicy inside, and best of all, fully cooked. Too bad this time the waffles were burnt and inedible. Sigh....In addition to the food, service was not Park Hyatt worthy. Our waitress did not bother keeping our water glass filled. When we asked for some more, it seemed like we were harassing her. DC has tons of good restaurants with impeccable service (e.g., Le Diplomate). If I am going to pay the prices that Blue Duck Tavern demands, the food and service need to be worth it.",Geneva P.

We lucked out with good weather and were seated outside.  The servers were attentive and not intrusive.  Despite the fancy atmosphere, the restaurant featured simple American apps, entrees, and sides that were executed to perfection.  We shared sides of spinach, ramps and leeks, fries, and grits.  All of them were amazing, and four sides for 5 people was just enough.  I skipped out on an app, and went straight for the crispy skin salmon with a light cream and almond sauce.  Wow, it was so good, and went well with every side we ordered.  I can't wait to go back, though the prices are just high enough that I would come back for a celebration dinner or other special occasion.  Although I'd consider this a ""fancy"" restaurant, I don't think the dress code is as fancy as some other DC restaurants.  I got away with wearing a dress that I just as easily could have worn to a daytime outdoor party.",Lindsay C.
1309,Washington,2009-09-27,TwIAnhk_juM38UV0EOLYOQ,5, DC,"4.5 stars.  Bad news bears first--the much vaunted fries were a huge disappointment.  I was expecting deliciously thin, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, super savory fries.  Instead, they were the thick cut slab like things, undercooked, and without much flavor.  Even though the portion was small--10 to 15?  fries--my friend and I didn't finish it.  The soap and lotion in the restrooms smell overpoweringly of strong Vol de Nuit--do not like.The service: Hover-y but exceptional.  While I definitely had the feeling that we were being carefully observed (I was facing the dining room) and would signal my friend to lower her volume if we were being inappropriate (often) as someone walked by, the server definitely made an effort to be unobtrusive.  As in, even though our server and other servers and the manager(?) were constantly making the rounds and making sure we were all happy, I saw a few times when our server started to approach us, realized we were deep in conversation, and stepped back.  Our server was great from the beginning, asking us if we had any questions, ably answering all our questions, and generally laying on the charm.  I was coming down with a cold, so I asked him if they made hot toddies.  Since he wasn't familiar with it, I told him the ingredients then asked that the bartender make one only if he had made them before.  Lesson learned after asking bartenders who have no idea what mojitos are to make one based on my description.  The bartender turned out a decent hot toddy, but it was comped for me anyways, which was nice.  Our server was also really attentive in working with us to set the pacing of our meal and determine when we wanted each dish to appear.  The atmosphere:Cozy, warmly lit, clean lines without fussiness.  The very solid front doors are painfully heavy.  The hostesses are elegant and European, and as a northerner, I much preferred being addressed as madam v. the ubiquitous ma'am I get in DC that makes me want to respond, I'm not 50, don't ma'am me.  They were having a pretty slow night so it was nice and quiet for conversation but not so quiet you feel like you're in a museum and need to whisper.  The bathrooms are gorgeous.The food!We had the bone marrow, which were three huge bones and a wonderfully flavorful roasted whole garlic clove.  I enjoyed the marrow, which had a richer, fattier flavor than I'd been expecting.  The soft roasted garlic was an amazing accompaniment, and I enjoyed just mixing the marrow with the garlic and eating it straight instead of spreading it on the nice toasted bread it came with.The mignonette oysters were perfect; on the small side but plump, fresh, and the accompanying sauce was refreshing and let the flavor of the oysters shine through.I love duck and crab cakes so it was hard to decide.  But since our server told us the new menu would feature duck confit, which I love more than the braised duck currently on the menu, I decided to go with the crab cakes.  I have to echo several yelpers and say I have never had better crab cakes.  Small, but perfectly formed from almost 100% crab.  As with the oysters, the flavor of the seafood was front and center, though I did like the tartar aioli on the side.  Hmm I could have eaten them twice over.We ended with the vanilla custard, which changed the way I feel about custards.  Usually, I wouldn't eat a custard or flan unless it was going to be covered with delicious burnt sugar in a creme brulee.  However, our server recommended this one and it far exceeded my expectations.  The custard was well set and had a beautifully smooth texture.  It was speckled with vanilla flecks, and the plum sauce and buttery crumble pieces worked so well with it.  It was also a large enough portion to share with one or two other people.  Along with our check, our server brought out chocolate embedded with pistachio and almonds--such a rich bite that I couldn't finish the small piece on top of the custard already in my stomach.  He also brought out a parting present of a bag of pistachio almond cherry muffin cakes, which were delicate and moist.  I'll definitely be back for more crab cakes and to try the duck.",Theresa W.

The short rib was as good as I've ever tasted, and lets just say that I wish I had their recipe for those brussels sprouts.

Point 1: I asked if the fruit & vegetable juices were bottomless, and although they are not, he was more than happy to fill my glass of pomegranate & orange juice when it became empty. Point 2: I had heard about the bone marrow being spectacular here but did not see it on the menu. Upon seeing my crestfallen expression, our waiter immediately went to the kitchen to inquire if a special order of bone marrow could be prepared. The results? A smile on my face and a happy belly full of delicious wood oven roasted bone marrow that comes with garlic cloves & bread.

All ze good food.I enjoyed that its presented as 'family style,' making it easy to share.The menu is great for anyone - no matter your dietary preference.Wine list layout made it easy for someone to find a great bottle. First course: CHARCUTERIE BOARD (C+) - the selection was eclectic, but wasn't blown away. Not everyone enjoys pickled, sliced, Lamb's Tongue - which wasn't bad - it wasn't good, but it wasn't bad. On the other hand, the Duck Prosciutto was awesome.Second course: ROASTED MUSCOVY DUCK BREAST (A-), HALF ROASTED ORGANIC CHICKEN (B+), SUCKLING PIG (A+). -- The duck breast was verbally presented as medium rare, but it was medium, which I'm happy about. It was extremely flavorful, and not like any other duck breast I've ever tasted. They really know what they're doing. -- The half chicken was cooked Perfectly. -- The suckling pig was melt in your mouth tender. It's so tender, it becomes difficult to pickup. Amazing. Sides: CREAMY STONE-GROUND GRITS (A+), CRISPY BRUSSEL SPROUTS (A), ROASTED WILD MUSHROOMS (B). -- Easily the best grits (or polenta) I've ever had, and possibly the tables favorite portion of the meal. The smoked gouda turns this dish all the way up. -- I'm a big fan of Good brussel sprouts, and these were great. There was a zing from the lemon juice and capers, and great flavor compliment (sodium) from the pecerino. -- Roasted wild mushrooms were good. I prefer a meatier assortment of mushrooms, and these were micro mushrooms. Good, but not as impressive as anything else we had. ***The best thing about dinner was that Everything within our second course went so well together.***Third course: APPLE PIE (A-), MILK CHOCOLATE S'MORES (A+) -- The not-so-classic apple pie FOR TWO. It is more than enough pie for two, but I would ask for an additional scoop of ice cream. The best part of the pie, the crust, but what was even better, was its crisp, almost bruleed top. -- The deconstructed s'more w/ caramelized banana.

The restaurant is an American culinary classic, from the Four Seasons Fountain Room-inspired bar (think slightly subterranean), to the open-air kitchen and prep stations (inviting), and to the seasonal menu that fanatically adheres to a fresh, local, and (when possible) organic regimen.I suspect that people who rate this restaurant 3 stars or below have just become way too accustomed to eating very special meals too frequently or are nauseatingly contrarian. I sincerely hope that I never eat so well in my life that would ever feel like the Blue Duck Tavern compares favorably to a typical three star restaurant. It isn't even close to this, so rest assured that whatever money you drop here will be well spent.Bottom line: this is a special restaurant regardless of who you are, how much you make, or how accustomed to gourmet food you are.

Cocktails were wonderful try the Grapefruit Gimlet!  Perfect!Rundown of what we had:Bone Marrow:  enough for three people the croutons in my opinion could have just been toasted, the butter was a little much and left a heavy taste in my mouth...kinda like fat on fat crime.Octopus confit:  very good considering that they had a good balance with the acidityThe sturgeon rillettes:  DEFINITELY the best choice!  Creme fresh had just a touch of acidity to counter balance the fattiness of the rillettes....I still think of this dish and my jowls are watering right now.Main dishes:  Duck, Braised short rib( Long bone), and sword fishDuck:  with the fat still left under ths skin this dish I did not enjoy too much very pedestrian!Braised shirt rib:  very lean considereing the cut and also very easy to share.  cut into 3 sections.  House made steak sauce was really good.Swordfish:  order the fresh fish of the day.  A buddy of mine ordered this and he kept on saying it tasted like compressed fish cakes.All in all a good expereince I would say that the only gripe I got is that they made us wait 30 minutes for our table.  Had a 8:15pm res and got seated at 8:45pm  I was enjoying cocktails so I didn't really care but this would piss most people off.  Cheers and happy eats!",Kevin K.
1334,Washington,2012-03-28,qZiZRv9Kpqp0PKoTSAmj1A,4, DC,"This is a review of dinner at The Blue Duck Tavern. The first thing you need to know is that it's too expensive for anything but very special occasions (wedding anniversaries, promotions, winning the lottery, etc). So don't bring a first date here or suggest it for your next book club meet up. And if you're footing the bill, make sure you love everyone at the table.That said, expect to pay at least $100 per person -- more if you order a nice bottle of wine after a cocktail or two. It can be broken down somewhat like this: $50 food, $30 drinks, $20 tax & tip.Appetizers and sides can be reasonably split. To determine how many to order for the table, divide your party size by two, and then add one. For example, a group of four would order 3 appetizers and 3 sides. As others have said, the oven roasted bone marrow was phenomenal (and easily split between four people) and the braised beef rib was considered one of the best entrees at the table. The hand cut fries cooked in duck fat were not as sensational as I was hoping (the ones at the Cake Bar in Lewes, DE are better) but certainly worth a try. As far as the desserts, the apple pie didn't live up to its reputation as being their signature dessert, but the chocolate cake with brandied cherries was well received. Finally, if you take them up on adding vanilla ice cream to the pie, what you will receive is a separate $9 order of 3 scoops (not a $3 add on).While you might not be inclined to bring a child (and for good reason), they offer a children's menu with entrees like hamburgers (which include fries) in the $12 range.Dress is business casual -- so try not to show up in a t-shirt, even if you're being ironic. Throwing on a tie and a jacket would not look out of place. Enjoy.",Neil H.
1335,Bowie,2015-08-23,3AdbEwK5s_udlEO1TGciQw,5, MD,"Took my wife here for our anniversary dinner. the ambiance is just right for such an occasion, its classy and modern-sofisticated. Open kitchen, no secrets, you can literally walk through it. It was a nice night so we decided to eat outside, the decor and environment outside was just as pleasing. We had Gladys as our server and she totally enhanced the experience beyond the decor and beautiful plating with her charm and warm spirit. She took great care of us. The quail was delicious and the duck was yum. The portions are good, we ordered an extra side, in hindsight that wasn't necessary. The apple pie is really good, I really liked the pastry and the slightly tart taste of the thick cut apples. I strongly recommend adding the homemade vanilla ice cream. They have a very extensive wine menu. Great beer and cocktail selection, and they had a few ciders as well. We'd definitely go again and ask for Gladys.",Dino M.
1336,Washington,2013-02-14,yO0Sd7leOkulZy2JWjakdw,4, DC,"A friend and I saw an article in the Washington Post about the fondue that is served in the lounge.  We decided to try it out for our Singles Awareness Day date!  I am so glad that we did.I somehow lucked out an found parking in a usually difficult area to park.  I told the hostess that it was my first time at the restaurant and she took the time to show me the dining room, lounge, pastry kitchen and to explain their open floor plan.  Very interesting.I got there a little bit early and decided to get a drink at the bar while waiting for my friend.  Charles, the bartender was very knowledgeable and helped me to decided on a Cabernet Fran Rose.  I was entertained just watching him make craft cocktails with such precision.We moved to a lounge table when my friend arrived.  The chairs are armchair style and amazingly comfortable.  I am a huge fondue fan and was pleased to hear that they offer a rotating menu of different daily fondue selections.  Tonight's was smoked Gouda with bourbon!  Delish!  I also love that they give you such a variety of dipping choices: endives, raisins, pear, apple, bread, dried apricot.It was a great atmosphere to catch up with a friend for a good conversation.  I will be back soon to sample more wine and fondue choices.",Lauren K.

1338,Houston,2011-07-15,norgsfxTBFGz0O29ZOamdg,5, TX,"*Brunch Review*Quick and dirtyHours: Brunch begins at 11:00. If you get there earlier, you'll be asked to sit and waitCost Per Person: $30, excluding drinksBest dish: Short Rib Hash, CroissantAvoid: Mocktails, not worth the priceService: A little bit awkwardLocation: In the Park Hyatt The StoryMy wife and I went to DC for the weekend to take engagement photos for two of our friends. They had told us that they planned on taking us to Blue Duck Tavern for brunch. Of course, being the food fanatic that I am, I salivated over the menu for the days leading up to our excursion.Upon entering the Park Hyatt , we were greeted by an awkward hostess. When I say awkward, I mean she didn't really know how to react to a group of four being 10 minutes early for their 11:00 brunch reservation. It didn't bother me that much, but 15 minutes later, one of our companions was clearly agitated at being ignored in our little glass box (our table was in an enclosed glass box that had an open top). I liked the glass box, I felt like I was on the show Get Smart or something.After the wait, we were ushered to our table where another awkward waiter was eager to please. He dropped off our fresh baked bread service with butter and left us to do our thing. Here is a quick breakdown of what we (our table) ordered:Cucumber Lemonade mocktail ($8): The low-light of the meal for me. My straw was constantly clogged with cucumber seeds and pieces of lemon. The flavor was good, but nothing outstanding. For that price, I was expecting much more. I think I'd prefer it muddled and then strained.Homemade Croissants and Jams ($12): The highlight of the meal for me. The croissants came out still hot and about as buttery as you can get them. The spreads included ricotta, honey, grape, and boysenberry (I think). Just fantastic.Scrambled Eggs with Rock Shrimp, Potato Roesti ($20): Only had one bite of this dish and it wasn't memorable. Can't give a good or bad recommendation for it. Short Rib Hash With Olive Oil Poached Egg x2 ($19): My friend raved about this dish, and rightfully so. Know that it comes with a flaky, buttery biscuit, a nice surprise bonus. Breaking the poached egg on the super tender short rib and then spreading that on the biscuit is about as good as brunch gets. House Smoked Salmon and Bagel, Cucumber, Red Onion, Herbed Cream Cheese ($19): The salmon, cucumber, onion, and cream cheese are just as you would imagine it--delicious. The bagel adds a nice texture to it, but a bagel I had at Einstein in the Detroit airport was just as good, if not better. The service was attentive, but overbearing. This brunch, however, was truly special and I guarantee I'll be going back again.",Jarrod M.
1339,Silver Spring,2014-02-02,4INScn5_1phcCwlIFAJvCQ,4, MD,"After reading about Blue Duck Tavern for years as one of DC's best restaurants, I only recently tried it. We made reservations well in advance because we knew it was popular, but it actually doesn't seem impossible to get a reservation. The restaurant is in a semi-out-of-the-way area (if you live in the city and are not visiting), but it's worth it. Although it's attached to the Park Hyatt, you'd never know it was a hotel restaurant from the inside. It's very classy with a lot of metal and glass, but wood tables and chairs add a somewhat more rustic feel. Personally, I still think the metal and glass won out and gave the restaurant a colder feel than what I was expecting. When we first got there, the host seated us immediately but wasn't the most friendly. I was worried that the service might be a bit stuffy from our first impression, but luckily, the waiter wasn't at all. The waiter explained the menu to us and gave his recommendations (which were similar to what I'd read on Yelp). He gave us plenty of time to decide while he took our drink order. When they didn't have the bottle of wine we wanted (based on a colleague's recommendation), the waiter recommended a similar bottle that he said was also very good and $10 cheaper. I appreciated that he didn't recommend something way out of our price range. The wine we had wasn't my favorite, but my boyfriend liked it. To start, we got the bone marrow, as it came highly recommended by pretty much everyone. Let me be frank - I am a picky eater. The thought of eating bone marrow does not appeal to me. However, I wanted to give it a try and I'm glad I did. It looks completely weird and I couldn't think about it too much, but after smearing some roasted garlic and scooping the bone marrow out onto the toasts provided, I realized why people recommend this appetizer. The combination of flavors and spices is great -- I'm not even sure all the different elements involved, but the result is very very tasty. We polished off the bone marrow without a second thought! We also got a kale salad, which was very good and a nice complement to the rich bone marrow. They also bring fresh bread to the table, which was also very good bread with salted butter on the side. For our meal, we split the beef rib (also highly recommended), the roasted chicken, the duck fat fries, and the brussel sprouts.  The sides were definitely my favorite. The brussel sprouts were perfectly cooked - nice and crispy and filled with flavor. It's always nice when you're eating something covered in a ton of butter but you can at least feel like it's healthy because, well, it's green, right? The fries were also great, with garlic aioli on the side. To be honest, I only ate one because they're large and because I was so stuffed from everything else. That says nothing about their quality though - they were great and we did take all our leftovers home! The beef rib was fall-off-the-bone tender, as others have said. It was also not dry like short rib can get. The flavor was great. The chicken was a surprisingly big portion - basically half a chicken. It wasn't my favorite roasted chicken, but it was cooked well and had some nice skin on it. It also came with a little bit of braised greens. For dessert, we were disappointed that they didn't have the chocolate dessert I had seen in photos, so we just went with ice cream. They had three flavors - chocolate, vanilla, and black sesame - so we decided to try all of them. The chocolate was VERY rich, even for a chocolate lover, but it tasted great mixed with the vanilla, which had great flavor even on its own. The black sesame was....interesting. It wasn't for me, but it was interesting to try - kind of tasted like an everything bagel. We commented to the waiter that the black sesame wasn't for us (more as general feedback on an interesting flavor than a complaint - we weren't complaining at all because we were the ones who had decided to order it), and we were very surprised when the waiter took the ice cream off our bill because we hadn't liked it. It was a nice touch even though we insisted it wasn't necessary - the waiter didn't have very many tables and he made it a point to pay attention to everything. The service was very impressing overall. I'm not sure how often we'll go back to Blue Duck Tavern because of its location and the fact that there are so many other restaurants to try, but I do recommend it. Our meal ended up being about $200 with a bottle of wine and a TON of food. Like I said, we took home leftovers because we definitely ordered too much. I recommend giving Blue Duck a try when you want a nice night out or you're celebrating a special occasion.",Jess G.

I had the lightly smoked swordfish with bourbon succotash, bacon, and  garden beans and it was blah. My sister-in-law had the pork chop with greens and it was superb. I wished it was my meal.

The water level in my glass never fell below 3/4 full, which was both nice and kind of annoying at the same time, but only because I constantly feel the need to say, ""thank you."" For his birthday, my husband had the duck. The menu said confit, but he thinks only the leg was made confit. The duck breast, though good, was not nearly as good as the leg. I think he should have had the short rib. You just cannot go wrong there.They only get four stars because it is colder inside the restaurant than outside. It's not very comfortable, which is a big deal when you're paying so much for dinner. Please turn on the heat! I think the a/c made my food cold.",Adrienne L.

The bone marrow appetizer was both beautiful and delicious, the garden salad over dressed. The theme that repeated through the night was great food, or good food that was over seasoned.

Here's the rundown.We started with the Poached Lobster (which was served on top of a little fried pork cake, on top of a pea puree, sprinkled with chitlins.) Was PHENOMENAL. I couldn't stop talking about it. We also got the Bone Marrow app, which was a garlicky delicious spreadable wonderland of awesome.I had the scallops, which were perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. It's hard to get crazy creative with scallops, and it wasn't anything that blew my mind, but it was well executed and delicious. My boyfriend had the suckling pig, which he was equally impressed with, but his dish in particular we were disappointed in the portion size--it was probably 4 ounces. We shared the creamed corn (AMAZEBALLS) and the veg of the day (which was rapinni with cheese and an egg on top...yummmm). Desert was the lemon tart which was so perfectly done...it was the perfect combo of tart and sweet and i LOVED the crust. They also were very sweet and brought out some ice cream with a candle in it for my boyfriends birthday's-- I never asked for it, they just picked up on it when I mentioned we were there to celebrate--so sweet!The service was equally fantastic. Our waiter was a little spotty, he was there for the order of the apps/entrees but then we never really saw him again. But he had wonderful assistance from a food runner who bussed our table, took our desert orders, etc and made sure we were well taken care of. Even with our waiter's mysterious disappearance half way through, I never felt as though I was lacking in service.The ONLY reason I give BDT 4 stars instead of 5 was that I wasn't a huge fan of the service presentation. Everything is served in individual chafing dishes. This is fine for the apps, and the shareable sides...but I mean....this isn't exactly family style portions people.

But nope, not at BDT! The really awful mushrooms were right there on the bill when it came time to pay.I didn't raise a stink about it; I ordered them, they served them, that would be unfair of me.

I told the server and she took it away, then brought it back literally 3 minutes later in another dish w my same half piece, and it was even colder. I told her and she took it away again, then brought it back saying it was a new one. It wasn't. My now 3 1/2 slices had been re-heated to medium well. My once buttery steak was reduced to a dry mess. My beautiful pairing of asparagus and wine were a distant memory. I called over the manager who made me new dishes and the steak was med-rare in the middle, and warm, but well done on the edges. I just ate it, because after an hour I was really hungry. I also had the shortcake that was short on strawberries and really tart. But whatever. What was supposed to be a quick dinner turned into midnight by this point and I just wanted to leave. Surprise when the bill came that I wasn't comp'd a glass of wine for the hour delay, but charged double for my steak and asparagus that had to be re-ordered. I just had it at that point.  I would've been better off eating the first cold steak and leaving.  I would've saved on the xtra glass of wine and disappointing dessert, not to mention an hour of headaches. It was all super disappointing $130 later (for ONE person!)",Avani D.

1365,Queens,2011-04-11,T9uzOVA4GTob6IjCORnqqg,4, NY,"Perpetually on the quest for fresh, farm-to-table fare, Jen F. and I headed to Blue Duck Tavern for my last night in town (and her Good Luck on the CPA Exam dinner).  The restaurant is located on the ground floor of the Hyatt; the space is beautiful.  Although the open kitchen was not within our line of sight from our table, we walked past on our way in and caught a glimpse of the famous wood-burning oven.*We ordered a bottle of Albarino to accompany dinner (Jen is not a fan of red wine).  As expected at such an establishment, the markup on this particular bottle was 50%.  It did pair nicely with my dinner.  It is also interesting to note the abundance of wines from Virginia and the mid-Atlantic area.To start, Jen F. and I shared a watercress and shaved fennel salad.  The salad was very simplistic and had a few pieces of robiolo cheese and small slices of grapefruit.  The salad has a great citrus flavor, but it is not overpowering.  The portion size was perfect for sharing.For my main course, I ordered the scallops, which are prepared in lemon and thyme in the wood-burning oven.  I was expecting three, maybe four, scallops.  Instead, I was brought a platter with six or seven of the plumpest, juiciest, smoothest scallops that I have had in the US.  (Who else reaches for their napkin when they have gritty scallops?)  Jen F. politely declined the opportunity to share, and boy, did she miss out.I did sample a bite of Jen's duck.  It was perfectly cooked, juicy (although a little tough in spots), and the little wild huckleberries accompanying the duck gave such a savory dish a bit of sweetness and tartness.For side dishes we shared the beets with marcona almonds, collard greens, and fingerling potatoes with leeks and chorizo.  The simplicity of each of these vegetable sides makes one appreciate how less is sometimes more.  My favorite?  Definitely the collard greens!  The sauce used had just a hint of spiciness (plus I cannot resist green vegetables).And then it was time for dessert.  We shared the carrot bread pudding and the rhubarb and strawberry crumble.  Both were delicious; the carrot bread pudding was especially unique, tasty, and wow were those raisins drenched in rum!  Strawberries, however, are my weakness, and I could not resist spoonful after spoonful of sweet strawberries.Blue Duck Tavern is an excellent example of a restaurant that does not try to manipulate and shock the senses.  Rather, it is the type of restaurant that prides itself on resourcefulness and freshness; doing the most with the fewest ingredients and gimmicks.  For a special night out, it is definitely worth it.* There was also an extremely pregnant woman throwing back red wine at one of the tables nearby.  I tried to keep how appalled and disgusted I was to myself.",Dana F.

1369,Madrid,2011-07-07,GosnDLRWcDjlkZt-MmAnjw,5, Spain,"Blue Duck Tavern (BDT) does not disappoint--I called on a Friday after it closed asking for a table for their Saturday brunch. Um, why'd I even bother? Because the awesome guy who answered was able to fit me in, that's why.An open kitchen and dining space with more private dining areas for events and special occasions, the high ceilings, modern architecture and choice of decor materials foreshadow the delectables to come: fresh ingredients, simple methods executed with understated attention to detail. The result? Masterful flavors rich in dimension and subtlety. Familiar dishes that somehow taste...more. My personal favorite are the baked eggs. Fresh eggs baked in a skillet with peppers and onions. Seems easy enough, but somehow, gastronomic heaven, these eggs are accompanied by incredibly buttered, ""toasted"" bread (read. huge astounding croutons--so good), and a small salad.  Generally, my friends and I end up getting at least one meal for everyone to taste as well, usually one of the specials, the french toast, or the variety of baked bready joy. I've yet to taste a dish that wasn't superb here.The service is impeccable. 5 Weeks without a kitchen, I've been to a number of places, and BDT is a refreshing change from the good food with poor service combo. They are professionals, prompt but not pushy, polite but not snooty, helpful but not ingratiating. Like their food they are balanced and simple. Sidenote: I love that it's one of the few reasonable places where you can get a little stool for your handbag instead of having to ask for an extra chair or let it share yours--ladies, this is a dining gold!",Katherine H.
1370,Vienna,2015-08-15,giTmp1mVl39vSzSXBh2LjA,5, VA,"I just noticed this was left off the Washingtonian's list of the 100 top restaurants. Well the Blue Duck Tavern would be in my top 5. And I am not saying it's not number 1. Jose Andres must have intimidated every food critic in town because his food rates from terrible (American Eats Tavern) to good (Jaleo). Bistro Bis is laughable and over salts everything. Le Diplomate is very good and over salts random items consistently. I have found BDT to be on the mark consistently to the point of brilliance. I just came back from Paris and the charcuterie plates I experienced there were very good but the one at BDT remains incomparable from its attention to homemade mustard (at a highly rated Alsatian French Bistro I was served a bottle of Heinz) to its garnish of pickles that are unworldly. If Mimi Sheraton, former food critic of the NY Times is alive we should bring her or someone she would recommend here. I think every food critic in DC wrote about the weather before being offered the food beat. Tom Sietsema is absolutely an amateur.",Marc M.

1372,Alexandria,2012-02-01,sZWdXXJM9JConFaF6TmDzA,3, VA,"I have been here for brunch a few times and dinner once - and the food is great. The smoked sturgeon rillette and the hash are absolutely ""must haves"". The dinner service and food were great, brunch food was one of the best in the area, but the service is very different, not bad, but just okay - you either get the over involved waiter or completely ignored for stretches at a time. My biggest complaint is that twice for brunch the staff working the front desk were rude and completely devoid of customer service skills. I made the mistake of showing up early (about 5 mins) for my reservation and could clearly see many (and I mean over 10-12) tables open - the greeter insisted we wait beyond our reservation time as not to ""overwhelm the servers"" - because after all it is all about making sure that the servers are comfortable right? She had a terrible attitude and kept trying to usher us off to the side of the restaurant to wait as if we were a bother for her to see  The second time, we arrived early for bruch (5 mins exactly) once again we were told we would need to wait past the reservation time so the could get our table set up (we were 2 for brunch mind you).

1374,Jackson Heights,2011-06-13,24hg4lqiTR_ysJV9Q1lM1A,5, NY,"One of the finest meals I've ever had.We came here for Sunday brunch - a time when most dinner-focused restaurants would staff with their ""B-Team."" We were not disappointed.The food was skillfully and intricately prepared, beautifully presented, and tasted as it should. The cod cakes were amazing (yes, it's fishy tasting...because it is fish). The hash was excellent and balanced. The waffles and chicken (I gawked at this idea at first) were divine. The waffle was soft, moist and light - the chicken was great - the cane sugar syrup..like fresh honey. We ordered the polenta (creamy yet decadent) and of course the BDT Triple Fries (beautifully herbed chunks of potatoes served with aioli). No, they're not super crisp like fast food fries... but they're also not mushy and dried out like your typical restaurant steak fries. They're cooked in duck fat - the holy grail of cooking mediums - and cannot be compared to many others. The chef actually caved in and prepared the bone marrow for our table - an item that is so highly recommended yet nowhere to be seen on the brunch menu. Phenomenal. Finally, of course... one must complete the meal with the apple pie with their homemade vanilla bean ice cream. The drinks.. okay, they were a bit pricey. I have to admit, the idea of paying $12 for one drink during brunch is not what I would prefer (usually, I prefer to get smashed from brunch with A-Y-C-D places). They were good. We ordered a pisco sour... a kind of curve ball to most places and were surprised that the bar actually had pisco. We had a moment of doubt when the bartender disappeared for a few minutes but were soothed when he returned with two brown eggs (he actually knew how to make a pisco sour!)The service is immaculate. It's that simple. It may seem ""over-dressed"" to some or ""overly attentive"" to others, we thought it was perfect. The staff knew when to intervene during the meal and they knew when to step back and let you enjoy the experience. Blue Duck Tavern puts many ""fine dining"" experiences in even NYC to shame. Every aspect is carefully orchestrated - both within the daring open kitchen and stations and in the dining room. Any in the field would agree that while this may be what is usually observed in the dining room - the kitchen is usually a step away from controlled chaos.So, if you're in GT..or just in DC you must come to Blue Duck. It is pricey for the area (but know that you're paying a fraction of what you would pay in Manhattan and getting waaaay more and waaaay better).",Peter K.

My husband and I are both in the early 30s, however we are often mistaken to be much younger and at times servers at upscale restaurant did not provide us the same level of service as they would to a mid 40s banker looking customers and we are used to that by now even though we make a good amount of money and consider ourselves foodies....At blue duck, our server was one of the best we have encountered.  I mistakenly ordered a mocktail not knowing it has no alcohol in it, when I asked if he could change it for me he said the bar already started to make it. Seeing how disappointed i was, he asked me what I would like instead.  Not only did he get me my real cocktail, he gave me the mocktail for free!!  Throughout the whole experience, he never left water unfilled... He came to us with a big smile every single time...We left him a generous tip cos we were so happy with his service!!Food- 3.5 stars: i wanted to like the food more, I really do, and I am not saying the food is not good, the menu is just soo uninspiring... We had the oysters on half shell for app, crab cakes and braised beef ribs for entree, fries and wild mushroom for sides.  Everything is tasty, however i just feel like i could get these dishes everywhere....There is pretty much no presentation of the food at all, i get it thats not what this place is about, The food is very home style and rustic, just not sure if it lives up to the hype..Overall I would recommend this place because of the decor and service.  We left the restaurant feeling satisfied and happy",Kerri O.
1382,Las Cruces,2014-10-12,U-BjztWu5SVElpzwLHxovw,3, NM,"I was not too impressed with this restaurant because the expectations did not match my experience, and most of these problems were entirely avoidable.  First, the name of the establishment suggests that it has a laid back, bar-type atmosphere, but it has pretty much the opposite.  It should be called the ""Blue Duck New American Restaurant.""  Anyway, that was the first thing I noticed that was strange.But the feeling of being misled for no good reason doesn't stop there:  The menu descriptions do not accurately or adequately describe what is actually served.  I think the best example of this is the ""shrimp & grits"" brunch entree that I ordered.  It was three large shrimp served on a yellow polenta cake.  The last time I checked, a polenta cake is not grits, and anyway, grits are usually white (not yellow).  The menu did not provide any sort of clue that the ""grits"" would be a polenta cake.  Also, the portion sizes for some entrees were a little on the small side, and I don't feel that enough explanation was given as to how to order.  It would have been nice if there had been some guidance as to how large the portion sizes should be so that I could have known how many items to order.Also, my companions ordered the ""chicken & waffles.""  It was essentially two fried chicken legs with a small, thick, waffle.  I don't recall seeing more than one waffle, even though the term ""waffles"" implies that there will be more than one.  There may have been two, but if so, they were much smaller than the chicken legs they came with.  My companions enjoyed the dish, but they said that there was nothing memorable about it.The drinks were the only exceptional part of the visit.  The highlight of my visit was the decaf latte that I ordered.  It was absolutely the best latte I've had in a very long time.  My companions also really enjoyed their drinks; one of their drinks came with a rock-candy lollipop in it, and that was a huge hit with the table.The waitstaff were very good, and the restaurant was nice, but the fact that I didn't get what I thought I was going to get was a big problem for me.  The food was just ok for the price, at best.  There was no ""wow"" factor for me at this restaurant.  I probably won't go back to this place again.",Steven J.

1390,New York,2011-02-22,zABL_UrPUIhYlLQivfdreg,5, NY,"I was lucky enough to get taken here for brunch by my sister this weekend while I was visiting from New York, and I think it may have been one of the best brunches I've ever had. We started out by each having the oyster of the day, on Sunday it was a California variety. They were delicious, super fresh, and their mignonette sauce is excellent!We asked the waiter if he would recommend the short rib hash or the lemon ricotta pancake, and he said that there's nothing better than the short rib hash on the menu. After tasting it, I would have to agree - we listened to him, and you should too! Don't bother getting anything else - the short ribs were perfectly cooked little bite sized pieces, mixed in with potatoes, onions, and some vinegar. It's served with creamy horseradish sauce, we mixed it straight in with the hash and it was amazing. On the side you get one of the best buttermilk biscuits in existence, and I went to college in Atlanta, so I'm qualified to make that statement. We ordered two sides - the blue cheese polenta and the BDT Fries. The blue cheese polenta is amazing - creamy, rich, and the blue cheese taste is not too overwhelming. I could have eaten nothing but that for the entire meal. The BDT Fries are good - big long chunks of potato that have been triple fried in duck fat. But what really makes them is the garlic mayonnaise served with them for dipping. Splitting the hash and two sides left us with MORE than enough food - we ended up taking some of the fries and a little bit of the polenta home. We each had two cocktails, mimosas and the standard bloody mary, and at $12 each they were fine but nothing special - I'd recommend skipping the booze at that price. Definitely a pricey brunch, but the food was so good it made it worth it. Ask to be seated away from the window - at prime brunching time the sun shone right through the floor to ceiling windows and made my seat unbearably hot, especially when I was eating such rich food.

My sister had the vegetarian sweet potato pureed pasta.  It is exceptional, enough said.  Bread and butter to start is good, bread wasn't warm but the butter cuts like butter and I really like how they have a warm butter knife.  It's just a great touch.Love the fact that it is family style, I always encourage/persuade when eating out with others to order family style.  if your confident in your culinary adventures, why just try one dish when we can all share!  right?!I really like the entrance, walking straight from the hotel lobby you enter through the kitchen.  First the pastry mise en place, then the main kitchen.  I really like how it is an open kitchen.  Next time I may ask to set up a table right next to the kitchen to learn some techniques!  Enjoy!

Crab cakes, Kale Salad and Bone Marrow was as good as advertised and everyone liked their dishes, which we all shared. Pig was very tender and flavorful although top skin should have been more crackling for my taste like the bits of crackling in the side dish. Wild mushrooms were good but not to die for, while the fries are over rated. Apple pie was best dish. Wine list was also above average. Only real negative was the bar. Way to small.",Eric W.

By far the most amazing dish was the braised lamb neck. The flavored blended seamlessly. Our table of three shared the roasted veggies (delish), the wild mushroom (perfect), the French fries (unlike any others you've had) and the rib eye, pork chop, and lamb. The lamb was the most brilliantly designed dish but all were 4-star quality. And - the Manhattan with white bourbon was magical.",Katrina T.

1398,Washington,2013-10-18,XNK6BOxjsoqcRTwd0itfDw,4, DC,"Was really excited to eat here after making reservations a month in advance. Our waiter was fantastic - dynamic and very excited to be serving. He was very knowledgeable and happy to give suggestions. Taking into account that I cannot eat gluten, he consulted with the chef, and they were able to make the bone marrow gluten free, giving me gluten free bread too!! The gluten free bread was really good, and trust me, I am not complaining, because a place that has that is a rare find, but it was kind of like standard toast and looked pretty sad sitting next to my boyfriend's normal bread. The duck was OK ... the sauce was fantastic, but the meat itself was a little chewy. The sommelier really knows his stuff and gave me a fantastic white wine pairing to go with the duck. The ambiance is incredible in most of the restaurant. Being able to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathrooms was great. The kitchens are huge and gorgeous, and unlike many restaurants, definitely something you'd like to see. Nonetheless, I'm still a little confused as towards why there is such hype over this place. It doesn't seem to quite warrant the impossible to get reservations, in my opinion, and have definitely enjoyed better meals at lower profile places.",K P.
1399,Washington,2011-02-09,vnpK1oMlo5z74jrHBf-hLg,3, DC,"I recently had the opportunity to eat at Blue Duck twice in one week.  I had brunch and I had dinner - and the verdict is 2 stars for brunch and 4 stars for dinner.  First, brunch - so very pricey and underwhelming.  I enjoyed my waffles with huckleberry compote, but my favorite dining companion's croque madame was not good.  It was basically an open faced ham and egg sandwich doused in way too much hollandaise-type sauce.  I find side items and good beverages to be the best part of brunch sometimes, but we couldn't bring ourselves to pay $12 for bloodies, $7 for coffee, or $8 for tea.  Tea!  C'mon.  Lastly, the sun was glaring directly into FDC's eyes, but the shade was ""broken"" and the waitress didn't know where to move us so his only recourse was to sit on the same side of our tiny table with me.  Dinner, on the other hand, was exactly the high-end quality and service that I would expect from a high-end restaurant.  We were a large group, and they allowed us to bring our own wine for a $25 corking fee per bottle.  I had duck, and my FDC had the angry trout (angry because the presentation includes his tail being stuck in his mouth) and both were tender and full of flavor.  The sides were great, too, in particular the celery root and pear puree was unexpectedly scrumptious!  The mac and cheese was unexpectedly not that good.  I go for the celery root, fingerlings and brussel sprouts when I go back.  So, all in all, not worth the splurge for brunch but I'd definitely go back for dinner.  I dig the open kitchen and the local produce.",C B.
1400,Washington,2013-10-27,RDToq4SXXc_i58zdEc97HA,1, DC,"This review has nothing to do about the food at Blue Duck Tavern, mainly because it is the opposite of the service which is impeccable, delightful, balanced and perfect. I have consistently gone to Blue Duck Tavern since it has opened its doors after they Hyatt underwent a renovation to become the upscale Parc Hyatt. I live a block away so it just so happens that I frequent Blue Duck on average once a week if not more.However, today I experienced a first for all of the years of fantastic visits to Blue Duck, they would not seat me! Why you ask? because apparently I was told they were in the in between phase of breakfast and brunch since I got there at 10:20am and they had last call for breakfast and had to switch over for brunch. Immediately questions popped into my mind:1) Why is this the first time I have EVER heard about this? 2) Does the kitchen or actual restaurant have to undergo a complete switch over? (A: kitchen)3) Did they have to turn me away from the entire establishment? (A: no, they could have acted accordingly and sat me, offered me a drink and perhaps some bread or something!)4) Why would they hire such incompetent staff?I was so distraught after this experience that I took to yelp which is rare ... I only write in extreme (good or bad) situations. Too boot, the hostess was flat out rude and had a shockingly poor attitude. Get it together Blue Duck.",J K.
1401,Laurel,2009-01-12,u8Iw4d4WNSfgB1WYhJ10bw,4, MD,"My friends and I had decided to come here for a little celebratory dinner.  We thought it was a good new place to try out and we were not disappointed.  The restaurant was a little hard to find in the dark.  The sign was relatively obscured.  Fortunately, we were able to identify the location from the valet of the Park Hyatt.  We meandered from the hotel lobby through the maze like path of the bar/lounge area and found our way to the front desk of the restaurant.  The establishment is very roomy.  The ceilings are high and the decor is very modern and very elegant.  The ambiance is high class without being aloof.We started out with some interesting appetizers.  We ordered the fisherman's soup, bone marrow and winter salad.  The soup was served, deconstructed and then combined at the table.  The flavor was excellent.  The broth reminds me of a bouilleabaise reduction.  The bone marrow was decadent and rich.  For a carnivore like me, the taste was heavenly.  The winter salad had some grilled cornish hen and fois gras that made it rather a standout from the usual salads.I ordered the signature smoke duck, while my friends ordered the peppered steak and vegetable pot pie.  The entrees were served on their pan and lets you share with your table mates.  My smoke duck was exquisite.  It was sliced duck breast served on top of a ragout of dark meats.  The duck was succulent and the flavors were outstanding.  My friend's steak was perfectly prepared.  I had a few bites of it and it was very good, but I thought it a little bland.  I had expected a little more spice given au poivre treatment.  The vegetable pot pie was light, crammed full of vegetable with a nice sauce.  I had also ordered a side dish of fennel that was really well-prepared.  The light anise/licorice flavor and sweetness really complemented the entrees.edit: oh how could I have forgotten so easily.  One of my friends ordered the BDT triple cut fries.  The fries were large cuts and deep fried in duck fat.  They were O M G, so good.  I could feel my arteries clogging up, but there are drugs to take care of that and I MUST have more fries!We finished off our excellent dinner with an apple pie and chocolate cake with ice cream.  The apple pie is dutch style.  The apple was just the right amount of sweetness with the cinnamon.  The chocolate cake was really rich and potent.  And the cappuccino was strong and invigorating.The wine is predominantly California wines with some French and a smaller selection of Italian and Australian.  We started with Belles Glos pinot noir recommended by the waiter.  It was fruity with deep cherry flavors and a short finish.  I ordered an additional bottle of Jordan cabernet sauvignon that was fuller body with exceptional tannins and oak.  Very chewy.  Both wines were very good.I must point out that the service here is exceptional.  From the valet, throughout the dinner and to the point that we left, the services were all first class.  There were some spotty moments during the dinner with the plates, but the wait staff was exceptionally expedient and rectified it all immediately.  This was one of the best dining experience that I have had in DC and is nearly deserving of 5 stars.  I reserve the last star because I like to make sure a restaurant is consistent and that requires more patronage.",Tony P.

We were looking for a place to take my brother-in-law and his wife while they were in town. We have been wanting to try this place anyways, so we thought why not give this place a shot. The bar area is pretty large and they have several different seating options besides just having a seat at the bar. We chose to sit in a glass enclosed table to have a drink before dinner.....sounds interesting, right! On the way to our table they actually walk you through the open kitchen...which was pretty cool. The menu was pretty interesting, so we ordered a little bit of everything! I will only mention some of the more memorable dishes though. For starters the sturgeon caviar...excellent!. The scallops and duck were fantastic....both were perfectly cooked! We shared the BDT Fries and the creamy polenta with blue cheese. I preferred the Fries to the polenta b/c blue cheese is just a bit overpowering for me, but they were nicely prepared and preferred by others at the table. The old-fashioned apple pie was a hit and it was like its own lil mini pie....so cute! Everyone had some and there was still some leftover, ha-ha. The ambiance of this place is extremely warm and welcoming. It made for a perfect dining experience and was exactly what we were looking for that evening.

I didn't expect the fatiness of the dish but regardless, it's incredible. Crab cake appetizer--Maryland style. It was fine. Huge chunks of crab meat. My dad really enjoyed the crab cake but I thought it was alright. The fennel slaw that came with it really made the dish but they didn't give you enough.Triple-cut fries--I know this is their signature dish; our waiter told us that they take some-odd amount of days to prepare these fries. I thought they were too fried though. They're crunchy-hard on the outside and soft on the inside, but it's like carnival food in how deep-fried they are.Bone rib--the beef is so incredibly tender and they serve it on the bone itself, which makes for really interesting presentation. It's a must-order.Asparagus--served with a Bearnaise sauce. It was alright.Apple pie--also a must-order. As you walk in to the restaurant, you can see the chef preparing them. It's got a thin caramel sauce on top and the apples are juicy-tender. Each table receives its own mini-pie, served super elegantly.I'd also recommend doing valet. It's only $10 and saves you the hassle of having to search around for street parking like I did.",Marissa G.

Please forgive my ""high standards"" and honesty**Maybe I missed something but I found this place just okay. We arrived on time for our reservation but waited about 15 min. For our table to be prepared. Kind of normal. For a Saturday night the restaurant was not the least bit crowded however so that was kind of odd. Decor is modern, minimalistic, but elegant. Our waiter was a little quirky but very knowledgeable about the menu and wine pairings. The food was ... Good? I honestly don't remember it much, but I know it wasn't bad. I would've remembered that. The bone marrow appetizer was disappointing. This was my first time having it, so maybe I'm just not a fan overall. They literally bring the whole bone to your table on a plate and your left to dig for treasure and slather it on French bread. There is hardly any marrow in the bone and the texture is rather gelatinous, greasy and very salty even when placed on bread. Upon first bite of the marrow, my date and I exchanged knowing looks of ""uh, never again"". For the main course, I had the ribs and my date had the rabbit. Both were good but nothing life changing. Yes, for all the buzz circulating around this place I wanted a life altering experience. Dessert was okay, I think. It barely left an impression. We had the chocolate cake with chocolate cinnamon ice cream. My date loves chocolate and I love cinnamon so we were both content but we've had better desserts elsewhere. Again, it wasn't bad but I wasn't blown away. I should say I'm a hard sell on dessert though. The bill was not as high as I thought it would be -- about $200 for two people. So, I actually think this place is rather affordable compared to other top DC restaurants. I don't mind this place but I'm not sure I really like it and I doubt I'll go back anytime soon.

Got seated around 9:45. We were brought to the lounge by the hostess while our table was cleared. She'd be back in a minute? I wasn't sure. There must have been miscommunication between the hostess and the lounge servers because we were offered a menu and asked if we'd be eating or just drinking. Since I wasn't sure why we were sitting there or how long it would be, I didn't really know the answer. Before I could stammer out a few words, the hostess came back and said our table was ready. The lounge server appeared confused, adding to the general overall confusion.Ordered a side (beets), main course (rabbit) and two glasses of wine to start. Told the server we'd keep looking at the menu and would definitely be ordering more food and a bottle of wine. At 10:15, we were told that the kitchen would be closing in 5 minutes, just after we'd received our food and before we could even order more. I realize this isn't a small plate, order in bunches type of place but they serve family style and should be prepared for grazing. The worse part was that we felt rushed and didn't even bother ordering a bottle. Barely got in an order of marrow and a spinach tart. I really wanted to try the apple pie but by then it was too late. Kitchen closed.1) What the hell kind of restaurant (in a fucking HOTEL no less) closes up shop before 10:30? We should have been warned as soon as we sat down, not 30 minutes into a meal.2) The service was extremely rushed and unfriendly. I don't even remember having a conversation with the server. He seemed to be ready to get the fuck out, which is how I felt by the time we were done.3) The beets were terrible. Undercooked and bland. The rabbit was not tender at all, I could barely cut into it with my knife. Needed lots of sawing.4) The bone marrow is actually pretty great. $150 for amatuer service and mediocre food.

It has a very sleek and open design that tells you this is a very fine restaurant but without the stuffy pretension. We all split the crab cakes and an order of the triple fries to start off.  The crab cakes were pretty good, not mind blowing but they were a nice starter. The fries are apparently fried three times (how they aren't overcooked is beyond me) but the last time they are fried, it is in duck fat. Yes, this makes them quite tasty. Dip them in the garlic aioli and we are off to a fantastic start.I was not a huge fan of the Croque Madame, which was texas toast topped with ham, gruyere, a fried egg and mornay sauce. It was good but it wasn't great. The short rib hash, on the other hand, was simply divine. I highly recommend you get this. Despite the fact that we were all halfway to a food coma, we had to split a dessert, which happened to be the chocolate cake. It was very similar to a lava cake (nice gooey middle) and pretty phenomenal.Overall, I highly recommend Blue Duck Tavern for brunch and I would like to come back sometime to try what sounds like an amazing dinner.",Mike S.

We arrived a bit early but were seated right away. Our server, Kristin (sp?), was really top notch. She and the rest of the waitstaff were always available, polite, courteous, but not too in our face. They provided great recommendations and we never had to wait for anything.We had the crab + avocado salad and a green salad for starters. They also gave us a complimentary glass of prosecco to start - nice touch. salads were delicious. For the main course, I had the duck breast and wifey had the wagyu. Mine was definitely the better choice. Served with a cherry compote, it was moist and super flavorful. Waygu was a little off-tasting, but overall good. We also shared the fries, which were excellent--crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, with plenty of flavor.For dessert, we shared the cheesecake. great crust - would highly recommend. Overall, the food was very good. But the service put it over the top. Maybe it's because excellent service is so hard to find these days...who knows?

1413,Foggy Bottom,2011-04-06,bU-WGo8RiQzdUEwBJbuS1A,4, Washingto,"A delightful dinner.For starters, the bone marrow was exquisite. There are very few things that could be so buttery yet not too heavy. When eaten with the thin slices of toasted bread and roasted garlic, there is an explosion of savory, rich flavor. The crispy texture of the toasts and the slightly spicy and mellow taste of roasted garlic compliments the marrow perfectly.Next was the escargot which was served in a puff pastry pie.  The delicate buttery puff pastry did go well with the escargot and the tasty sauce, but more snails would have been nice. Though it was not as delectable as the bone marrow, the dish was still enjoyable. For the main course, there was the beef rib, scallops, lentils and beets.  The beef rib was very tender. Unfortunately the steak sauce was a bit too overpowering, making the rib a little too salty. This dish seemed the most popular as I noticed many chefs in the open kitchen were preparing it.   Out of the entire main course, the Scallops were by far the best. There were five massive diver scallops served in a scrumptious light sauce. The scallops were cooked perfectly and did not have the metallic taste found in most scallops I have eaten. The sauce was not too salty, and I could not get enough of it. Unfortunately the lentils and beets were not as special. Both side dishes were well cooked, but the rather weak seasoning of the lentils and the beets which were basically served alone just did not cut it. Ending the dinner was the apple pie and the flour-less chocolate cake. The apple pie was quite good. The apples did not sink to the bottom of the pie, and they still retained their sweet aroma. The flour-less chocolate cake was just a tad bit too sweet. Without the flour, the ""cake"" essentially is partially melted fudge. Ordering ice cream, which comes in  generous amounts, would best compliment the deserts, but the pie and ""cake"" are both good in their own right.On a side note, the restaurant claims they serve ""family style"" for the side dishes but the lentils and beets were both served in rather small oval saucepans.",Ryan R.

1415,Arlington,2014-10-26,06ECs65IIzQNnzWOaol2hg,3, VA,"I have been to Blue Duck two times - once in 2012 and once over this past weekend in Oct. 2014.  The first time, the food and service were both very good.  The only thing that was a bit off was that they brought a different vintage of wine than I had ordered on the menu.  I pointed this out, and the waiter, in 2012, apologized that they did not have the wine that was on the menu and they only had the newer vintage, but he assured me that they would comp that drink, which was the CORRECT remedy and I appreciated it.  Well, I just went back this past Friday night and it happened AGAIN!!  I mean, once is a fluke, but twice? It seems to me that they must be advertising wines on their menu that they cannot actually provide the guests.  They really need up update their printed menus.  I ordered a Merlot of a certain vintage, priced at $17 a glass, and when he brought out the bottle, it was not a 2009, but a newer year.  I pointed this out to the waiter and he literally said nothing, not ONE word, and walked away. It was very odd.  We figured he was checking on it, but then it was like 10 minutes before he came back to the table and it was like he totally forgot.  He also did NOT comp the glass when we got the bill. I did not want to risk this guy taking even longer to serve us than it was already taken (service was very slow for some reason), so I just dropped it, also after being urged by my husband to just enjoy my birthday and just let it go. Our waiter was nowhere near as personable as the waiter during our first visit to the restaurant back in 2012.  The food was fine, but we ordered the apple pie dessert as it was described as ""baked in the oven and served PIPING HOT.""  Well, it was barely luke warm when it got to our table.  My husband also made the reservation a month in advance and informed them that it was my birthday, and they did nothing.  No candle in the dessert that we ordered, no mention of it, nothing. So, I don't know, there was definitely a lack of attention to detail or something that we did not experience the first time back in 2012.  The food is still very good at Blue Duck, but it is nowhere on par with other high-end restaurants in the DC area, such as a Restaurant Eve, or other places like that that really go above and beyond to cater to each customer.  Hopefully they were just having an off night.",Suzanne B.

They sat us in the ""semi private"" dining, room which initially I was not  happy about because it looked as if though they had stuffed us away in a corner, and that the service would suffer as a result.  However, it turned out to be quite nice because we had a lot of privacy and could be as loud as we wanted, and the service was great. We shared a bunch of appetizers and each got a main course. To start we ordered, Oven Roasted Bone Marro, Crispy Veal Sweetbread, the Lobster, a risotto and the sweet-potato pie. I thought that the sweetbreads were fantastic, they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and were served over orecchiette. The sweet potato pie was also fantastic and was the perfect blend of sweet and salty. The other appetizers were good as well.  As my main course I had the Muscovy Duck Breast, this is where the restaurant really disappointed. My duck was so tough that I couldn't even cut it with a knife, I mean I really had to work at cutting it in two, and it was incredibly chewy, not the way a duck breast is supposed to be.Overall this place had great appetizers and service, and the other dishes that I tried were good, but my main was disappointing, maybe they were just having an off night, still for a restaurant at this price point, your main course shouldn't have any major issues like that.

Had with two icicley vanilla globes (a la fashionable back when sugar started to become exuberantly access-ive rather than exclusive).Also had a braised white fish catch of the day that was pretty amazing if a bit on the supermodel thin side and truffle glazed polenta that was so creamy and smooth it was almost drinkable rather than edible.Their silverware, chinaware, metalware is as mod as anything.

Portions are a decent size too. I had the oven roasted vegetables to start and they were very flavorful. And my brother and I split the salmon and scallops...amazing! Cooked perfectly and very flavorful. Couldn't even make it to the dessert but Im sure it would've been excellent. They knew it was my birthday so they brought out some free sugar cookies and fresh fruit which was excellent as well. Only slight criticism would be that the bread basket they give you...the bread should be warm. Otherwise a perfect experience. Check this place out!",Maria C.
1423,Jenkintown,2012-01-21,M-oUTq82yKtV2B99pCvGiw,3, PA,"Competent but not nearly the rave that Washingtonian's seem to quack about.  Sexy chic atmosphere although the high sound level and ambience can leave you feeling cold.  The waitstaff are pleasant and non-obtrusive but sadly, sporadically present to refill water and clear dishes.  The food was simply good to very good but not great and certainly not stellar (I'm jaundiced by New York, Paris and Barcelona, so excuuuuuusssse me!); anyway, I thought it was more glorified steakhouse than a ""farm to table"" experience despite the recitation of the provenance for nearly everything on the menu.For appetizers, the veal sweetbreads with creamy grits and a soft boiled egg was tasty but the egg was too soft boiled and did little to add to the flavors of the very lovely combination of the sweetbreads and the grits.  Far better are the clams with peewee potatoes, lemon, artichokes and olives. The sweet flavors of the clams and the deeply flavored olives matched well with the lemony and garlicy broth in which they were steeped.  The artichokes were a bit like the egg in the previous dish, they didn't add much other than another ingredient.The Bison Shank was very tender but the accompanying cocoa nib and stout sauce was far too sweet for the densely flavored cut of bison.  I didn't see the point of burying one heavy flavor with another heavy flavor.  It was served with a marrow bone of indeterminate origin which again was clobbered by the sweet sauce and reminded me of a spoonful of fat with jelly on the side.Braised Beef Rib with the home made steak sauce was clearly a winner.  The meat was ""fall off the bone"" tender and the steak sauce complemented rather than struggled for dominance with the meat.  Also enjoyable and rather simply prepared was the fish of the day, which was, I believe was bream.  It's not as easy to do fish and do it well as most people would think but the flavors were somewhat unidimensional.  I rarely order fish in restaurants (except ethnic restaurants) and this dish is a prime example of why I don't...it tasted like fish, period.  And that is boring after three or four bites.Sweet potato pasta with salsify was gummy, sweet and under-salted.  ""What was the point of the dish?"" seemed to be the universal comment at our table.  Was it simply lip service for the vegetarians amongst us?  If it was anything else than that, we all missed it.  The ""signature"" side dish that was most puzzling was the french fries.  They were, I believe, fried in rendered duck fat which should have made them delicious if not outstanding.  The problem was that they were almost too thick (think steak fries) and also way under salted.  I'll take under salted from the kitchen any day but please allow me to add salt if I so desire without making me feel like I just asked the waitress if she'd show me her breasts.  The fries were too mealy to be enjoyable and sort of reminded me of mashed potatoes on a stick.The wine list is thorough, albeit expensive.  In a town where dining choices abound, the success and popularity of BlueDuck is a testament to the fact that money does not equal taste.  There are better places in DC that serve more creative food done equally well for less money.  The value proposition here simply doesn't work.",Bob Z.
1424,Washington,2013-03-24,RDSxGIivkunQLjqCDvpnsw,2, DC,"I have been to Blue Duck on several occasions and found it to be very good, but with small portions and pricey.  Unfortunately, the quality seems to have gone downhill since the last time I was here a few months ago.Today, I took a new client there along with two of my associates and was horribly disappointed in the service and left hungry because the portions were just so small.  We all ordered salads and entrees and all of our food came out at the same time - and when I complained, the food runner said, ""You mean, you don't want your salad at the same time as the rest of your food?""  I wanted to say, ""No, idiot, I don't."" (but I held my tongue).  After my client left his salad uneaten, I told the waiter, and he said basically the same thing (but did offer to take that salad off without me having to ask).  The problem with that (other than my steak getting cold while I was eating my salad) is that there was no room on the table for all of the plates.  Also, I asked for a refill on our bread, and the waiter forgot, so I had to ask the food runner to bring us more bread.The thing about the portions - my mixed greens salad was $9, but if it were $6, I would have said it was too small.  My wogu steak for $28 was appetizer sized and came with a two inch by two inch ""tater tot.""  Again, if I had paid $16 for this, I would have thought the portion was too small.  I bought a $16 lobster salad to carry back to my secretary and her comments after opening the box were ""That's it?"" and ""There's not much guacamole there, is there?""Another thing about this restaurant is the physical layout - on a trip to the bathroom, you have to walk through a food preparation area, and I am not kidding, two waiters and waitresses almost ran directly into me on the trip to the bathroom and one on the way back! The only good thing about this trip (which is consistent with my other times there) is that the food is perfect.  But, I think that, for the price charged, they need to serve double the amount. I really hate leaving a restaurant and being hungry.  I am so glad I found a Kellogg's Pop Tart in my office when I returned or I would have had to run out to McDonald's to satisfy my hunger.In the end, I have to say that Blue Duck tremendously overrated:Service - 2 starsTaste - 5 starsQuantity - 1 starValue - 2 stars",J.P.

1425,Brooklyn,2013-12-16,MMBRWZXUhPdOBG8wK-J2cQ,5, NY,"Kick ass.A little expensive, but you understand why. Brunch for 2 was over $100 with tip, but we went all out:two teas are 7 dollars each, but they each come in a glass pot over a burner to keep it hot.Chesapeake Caesar, Bloody Mary with clam juice and Old Bay on the brim, fine but the least exciting thing on the menu.Roasted Marrow - my first time liking marrow! amazing and delicious. it is topped with a pumpkin ""granola"" which is just a few crunch and sweet crumbs which balance the marrow so well.Husband had chicken and waffles, with expertly fried chicken that tasted like chicken, delicious waffles and an egg. It was served with a great maple syrup that was aged in bourbon casks!I had fried chicken livers over smoked Gouda grits, two fried eggs and a little pepper sofrito.Cauliflower, roasted, with almonds and raisins, with a cheddar cheese fondue sauce in the bottom - maybe the best thing yet.Service was expert and polite, room is beautiful!

1426,Washington,2011-07-17,GRUOuRynmhV0FhSF725vkQ,4, DC,"Excellent service with great food in a relaxed, classy setting.For dinner, we started with the Roasted Beet Salad: the sweetness of the beets combined well with the tartness of the apples and slight bitterness of endive.The Braised Beef Rib is a must for this place. Slowly-cooked for hours, the steak sauce is infused in the meat. So tender, it falls off the bone. The Braised Rabbit was decent but the center was served rare and was so chewy that I couldn't finish it. I'm not sure what the fuss is all about for the BDT Fries, just tasted like thick-cut fries with some seasoning powder on it. The Chocolate Cake Flambe was the BEST part of the meal. Rich and chocolatey with a soft center and the subtle taste of alcohol from the flambe makes it a definite winner. Order it with a side of Honey Vanilla Ice Cream.",Tiffany W.

1429,Washington,2011-11-19,5P5qsVdm_cGGdNZKgKvkiQ,5, DC,"Blue Duck Tavern certainly has no reason to shy away form high expectations. High expectations were met and exceeded.We made the reservations the day before for a Friday night and wound up with a 6:45, which ain't bad. We requested either the fireplace or open kitchen and were accommodated with a brilliant table right in front.Our server was likely on the newer end of the spectrum, as she jumbled several of her descriptions (After a full minute of describing one of the starters: ""Oh, I said duck! I meant the goat!"" Er, small difference.) But this truly was merely a minor detail, as the service throughout the night was nothing short of spectacular (they brought me a stool for my purse, for crying out loud) without an ounce of pretentiousness. We started with both the goat and the bone marrow starters. Bone marrow because it would be a first-time experience, and I hold tightly to the ""at least once"" train of thought. The consistency is slightly gelatinous, which may not sound appealing, but the flavor is mild but rich, thick and creamy, a bit nutty. Absolutely divine when paired with a spread of the roasted garlic that is served with it. Our server called it ""good for you."" Perhaps the high protein? Let's go with that. The goat was tender and the pita served as its feeding mechanism soft and warm. We had to fight over the last bite. :)For the main deal, we split the braised beef (as good and tender as everyone says it is, so I won't go into it further) and the duck. My husband commented that he'd never had duck more perfectly flavored. Not to mention that the skin was nice and crispy. I had a few instances where I had to work to saw through the fat - but, I guess it is duck. The duck fat fries on the side may have been the best fries I've had in my life, thanks to the perfect cut. While fried and crispy, the inside was still substantial (as in, plenty of potato, not empty like thinly cut fries) but not bland, dry and boring. No. The inside was moist and flavorful, with just enough potato for the dipping sauce to cling to it in just the right amounts. The side of leeks was impressive and satisfied my craving for a fresh, juicy, nutritious veggie.For dessert, we split the pumpkin cake and the apple pie. Usually I'm a sucker for anything pumpkin, and the cranberries and walnuts seemed like such a nice touch, but my own pumpkin bread runs circles around the cake. Appropriate for the season but I could take it or leave it. The apple pie, on the other hand, is as good as everyone says it is, and humongo. Scrumptious. Buttery. Get it.Oh, and the drinks. The Moscow Mule was light and refreshing, the cider drink with the egg white? Mm. EXACTLY what I wanted. Not too sweet, perfect for the fall.One thing we both commented on throughout the night was the presentation. Each dish was presented in a simple yet classy style, more about the food on your plate and its origins than any swirly demi-glace on the plate.Highly recommend. Classy, but I felt perfectly comfortable in my skinny jeans and boots.",Taryn L.

1432,Washington,2011-09-15,nhvWpwPSaOPUYC9J21L_lg,4, DC,"If you consider yourself a burger aficionado, you should try the cheeseburger on their Lounge/Bar menu. Today, I am only going to talk about the Cheeseburger (as far as food goes). At $23, I was like...I don't know...that's pretty high for a burger. It is Kobe beef, so it's described, but still $23 is steep any way you look at it. The only burger, I've paid more for was the ""Black Label Burger"" at Minetta Tavern in NYC at $26. It was worth it, but I still walked away saying...come on $26...is that necessary? Well...Blue Duck is on to something with this burger, because call me a fool, but I'd do it again. The flavor and unadulterated, juicy, consistency with the melted cheese and bun (which does fall apart a bit) is pure burger perfection. The French Fries are crispy and make the perfect accompaniment. It's a different experience than Five Guys, Shake Shack etc...which I also love, but you have to take that into consideration going in...Part of what you are paying for is sitting in that cool atmosphere and drinking it down with some Flying Fish merlot (which you are also over-paying for:)...It's all about enjoying the moment for what it is. On another note... I've been to Blue Duck twice and both times the service has been what has kept it at a 4 star experience...Having said that, it's not so off-putting, that I wouldn't return again. Once it was a waiter who was overbearing, and definitely trying to drive up the bill with his suggestions...too much to get into here, but it was obvious...I'll leave it at that...This last time, my daughter and I had lunch in the lounge. The service was the opposite, almost non-existent. I had to ask the manager, who was walking around, for refills, the dessert menu, the check...It was a two hour lunch that could have been done in an hour tops.

I have always enjoyed a restaurant with an open staff pantry and kitchen. It's once said that Restaurants with open kitchens tend to have BETTER food.I enjoy dining at a great American restaurant and The Blue Duck Tavern is the place with an American fare preparing their dishes through simple, cooking methods such as roasting, braising, preserving and smoking. Every time we travel, it's all about the food. This time at the Blue Duck Tavern, our eyes definitely appeared bigger than our stomachs!

1436,San Jose,2011-04-29,u_7gL0xXZjO4zfIKWW8p4w,4, CA,"Walking into Blue Duck Tavern is like walking into a dream -- I immediately feel like a sophisticate. The decor in Blue Duck Tavern is modern, sleek and clean. I love the huge door that you walk in (my friend, Emily who I shared the meal with, likened it to Alice in the Wonderland!), the nice lobby/waiting area, the OPEN KITCHEN, and the overall classy and chic vibe. This is my second time there and both times I was impressed by the same things: the ambiance that I've already raved about, the attentive service, the amazingly wonder tender MEATS, and the most wonderful DESSERTS ever. This time, I tried the Roasted All Natural Chicken, which was cut into 4 pieces and really, cooked to perfection. Emily tried the Braised Beef Rib, which I had last time. We also ordered two sides: the Honey Stewed Sweet Potatoes w/ Chickpeas and the Purple Top Turnips Raisin Mostarda. Yeah, so sadly I was disappointed with the same things - their sides. I ordered the Sweet Potatoes (after asking the waiter if he liked that or the Arugula Salad), but received a little pot of... chickpeas really. There was maybe 4 or 5 small pieces of sweet potatoes. Deceiving! The turnips... well, the dish was mostly potatoes. When they brought out our sides, we literally thought they brought us the wrong order... Sad. This happened last time, too. I should have known. But it's okay, the dessert somehow always makes up for it. We had their famous apple pie, which came with a side of vanilla ice cream. YUM!!! First, it's as big as my face. And second, love how it comes out fresh and warm.. the crust is so flaky and light. It was the perfect way to end our dinner. (Last time I had this peaches & blueberry tart with a hazelnut mousse... I still dream about it.)Blue Duck Tavern is a little pricey and the portions may be a little small... the sides are not what you think they are. BUT somehow, I still love it. Compared to the many upscale, fine dining establishments in DC, Blue Duck Tavern still stands out. Perhaps it's the calm and classy atmosphere, the amazingly cooked meats, or the outstanding desserts. Whatever it is, I know it will draw me back.",Tiffie L.
1437,Washington,2010-12-06,vJSUt6Zvoo9eTpSIyhn3gg,5, DC,"Hands down, best meal I've had in recent history from start to finish.  Thank you now to my boyfriend who took me here for my birthday if you ever read these silly reviews.Summary:  Just darn good local, American food cooked absolutely perfectly.  Stellar service all around, above and beyond what you would expect from even this caliber restaurant.  Completely non pretentious - we were encouraged to share, eat family style, and order however you want (none of the ""how you should progress through the meal"" b.s).  Get the ribs and the spatzel ""Mac & Cheese"" - they will melt in your mouth.   The con: Only one- The hosting station. Their system for taking coats is just awkward. And there is no ""host stand"", so you sort of show up, smile and look a little confused and a host, hopefully, (we were there on what seemed to be a quiet Satuday) realizes you've come in and makes an introduction.  Getting your coats back is sort of a slow process at the end, and given that it was below freezing and that giant ""classic American"" wood door kept swinging open, it wasn't the greatest impression to leave what was otherwise a stellar and perfect restaurant. But I nitpick here..For some of you, the cost may be a con. But I argue the portions are massive for gourmet dining, hearty, and even with an entree and side per person we left feeling happily full. Sharing is also encouraged, so you can get away with spending far less and not feel like you've violated every etiquette rule to try all the dishes. The pros:The food was, obviously, epic.  I was literally soaking up the drippings from the beef rib with bread for 20 minutes.  Mmmmm, delicious memories.... But raving about the food need not be done. What makes this place special is the quality of the experience. You are swathed in luxury but none of the pretension that often accompanies it. Dining at the BDT is... comfortable. Like I said above, you are encourage to eat family style, share, progress through the meal however you want... They even give you little tongs to serve with.  They were A-ok with sending out more bread to let me slurp up that delicious sauce with, and I felt in no way judged  or ""wrong"" for enjoying this indulgence.  The decor is just absolutely beautiful. I'm a sucker for an open kitchen... but they even had an open pastry station.  The walk to the restroom passes right by both, so you can get an up close and personal look at everything going on.  It makes you feel, in a weird way, a part of how your dinner is being prepared.  There is a transparency to this I admire.The service was stellar.  I admit I ask a lot of questions and HATE being rushed.  Neither ever occurred. When picking a wine, the waiter was happy to bring me out a few to try and work with me to find one that was just what I wanted.  When we ordered dessert (the chocolate cake flambe) an order of the peanut butter ice cream just appeared on the table... we later found out compliments of the waiter because he just wanted us to have the cake the best way he knew it could be.  A water glass never went close to empty, and dishes and glassware were removed as soon as you finished with them. All in all.. a memorable birthday experience.",Brenna R.

This thing was FRESH! More like a pea broth and far from the thickness of a split pea soup.Oven Roasted Bone Marrow was the best that I've had at a restaurant! I recently had the bone marrow @ Church & State in LA but Blue Duck was HANDS DOWN the better of the two! Melted like butter with flavors that only enhanced the entire dish. It was also served with fresh oven roasted garlic cloves.Muscovy Duck Breast- cooked with a sauce that complimented the duck.My BF had the braised beef rib that was so tender that I don't think you needed teeth to bite into it!The only reason that I didn't give this place a 5 star was because...1.) I couldn't really taste the honey in the Honey Stewed Sweet Potatoes & Chick Peas.2.) I wish the apple pie was much warmer than how it was served but I have to admit that the top crust of this was the best part.DELICIOUS!,Linda D.

The food was mediocre at best. The triple-fried fries are just enormous fries that aren't particularly good. The suckling pig wasn't flavorful or as tender as expected, and the accompanying roasted vegetables tasted oddly watery. The New York strip was tiny and entirely overpowered by the Bearnaise sauce.

There are barely legible signs. You sort of stumble upon it. How do you know when you're close? Rocking chairs, bird houses on branches and HUGGGGE and heavy wooden double doors. It's a gorgeous setup with several open kitchen stations and chic glass booths that allow for both privacy and integration into the restaurant.OK let's talk food - Everything uses top notch ingredients and many local ingredients (wOOT)I've had their Lump Crabmeat Omelette and Brioche French Toast for Breakfast. By textbook standards, both receive an A on presentation and preparedness but lacked a personality to the dish.Lunch and Dinner, on the other hand, is another story. This is where the superb culinary skill becomes an art. Are you a bone marrow person? If you are, hands down, Blue Duck is the place to go. They hot dog slice a cow femur open. Take a moment... think about it - GENIUS idea! it's less messy and it's a LOT more. Yep, they gave us 3 halves for $14. Lunch and Dinner was solid but the Bone Marrow was simply upstanding.So why am I raving and only giving a 4/5?

1449,Rockville,2013-06-03,ygAPdQE25-Ny3K97vI08jQ,4, MD,"My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday dinner. We had gone before for brunch and remembered the unique quality of the food served, so we returned to see if their dinner menu offered the same experience. The service was really great but we did have to wait 30 mins past our reservation time. We didn't get upset because it was a busy night and we had been here before, so were willing to give it a shot. The bar is a little small and in a weird location within the restaurant. So, be CAREFUL you may spill your drink on yourself or run into the waiters. Once seated, the experience was remarkable. We were seated near the kitchen prep table and watched all the dishes get their final touches as they went out to their tables. I had gone over the menu prior to coming in, so I knew what i wanted before hand. We started with the baby wedge salad, red radishes, ""crispy pig ears"" and green Goddess dressing. Don't let the crispy pig ears turn you off, this is a MUST EAT salad. The pig ears are fried to perfection and cut into small pieces (its like eating flavorful pieces of bacon). The dressing was refreshing and just the perfect amount cascading over the lettuce wedges. For our entrees, I got the 12-hour roasted suckling pig and my boyfriend ordered the braised beef rib. Both of these dishes were bursting with flavor and extremely tender. We shared a side order of creamy stone ground grits that are by far the best I've had! They were full of flavor and cooked to perfection, if you like savory grits, you must try these. I also got an order of the sautéed wild mushrooms. Although, I wasnt able to convert my boyfriend to loving mushrooms, I rather enjoyed them! They were just the right amount of garlic, salt and parsley, cooked to perfection! Since we had a 30 minute wait they paid for our dessert. We were initially going to skip dessert but ended up ordering their apple pie (very tasty) and three different flavored homemade ice cream scoops (all uniquely flavored and delicious). All in all, we would definitely come back. Not only did we experience a decadent brunch menu but their dinner menu did not disappoint. It was a great experience despite the wait. The food was amazing and the atmosphere is enjoyable. You wont go wrong in this place :)",Ruth R.

My mind was baffled by this display, a huge clear box covered with images of pink cherry blossoms, where the bottom of the box is all mirror, so you get the impression that you are looking into infinity. Lucky for me the box did' nt have an opening, because I probably would have tried to go in for a closer look. 7 of us met in the tea cellar for light refreshments. This is a great place to conduct a professional working group, because its somewhat off to the side, they have these dinner table/desks you can work from, and if your guests do not know where to go as you look through the glass you can spot them as soon as they arrive at the hotel. We ordered red and white wines for the group. Cheese and meat trays that were filled with other little delicacies such as apple curd, raisins, apricots; snacks that most people just don't think to pare with wine at home, so for me it was a real treat! If you really want to make an impression on someone this would be the place. My guests felt appreciated and were very happy to be apart of something wonderful. The wait staff was so warm and attentive, I was greeted with smiles as soon as my colleague and I entered. It's the little things that count! Blue Duck produced a 4 Star evening!

1458,Westport,2011-01-21,Z2ExbIYHaF4fkUPulEC6Lw,3, CT,"I have been to Blue Duck for dinner twice. Each time there have been issues with my reservation. And by issues, I mean the restaurant has lost my reservation. I consider myself to be pretty understanding, but twice? When something like a lost reservation happens, I expect a complimentary round of drinks or an appetizer while I wait FOREVER to be seated. The Blue Duck did neither. During my last visit, my party and I waited in the bar for 50 minutes before we were finally seated at 10:50. Party of 4, 2 of us were having dinner. The other 2 were drinking numerous blackberry mojitos (which are wonderful, but quite pricey at $14). We were one of three tables still eating at 11pm. Our server was very efficient. Water was refilled constantly, service was unobtrusive and polite. However, while walking through the restaurant to use the restroom, one member of our party overheard our server rudely gossiping about our party. We were simply appalled at her inappropriate comments. Ugh. As far as the food is concerned, it is of course quite good. The agnolotti is sweet, light and rich. The vegetable soup is hearty and flavorful. The braised short ribs melt in your mouth, and are stunning. The fries are decadent. Side vegetables are buttery and delicious. The chocolate cake with Maker's Mark flambe and homemade ice cream is to die for. I really like Blue Duck. The atmosphere is lovely, the food is great, and the service was impeccable, aside from the snotty server. Hm, well, maybe they'll fire her and it'll be a non-issue.",Kara S.

My husband almost believed him until we checked with our credit union, and they confirmed that MERCHANTS (restaurants, hotels, etc.) may charge an additional %  on top of the bill, but they (the bank) does not do this - EVER.

So we were relegated to sitting on pivoting sofa chairs and eating from a glorified night-stand.That being said, the food was very good. I had the peppercorn seared tuna and she had the vegetarian agnolotti. I also ordered the blue cheese polenta because... how could I not. My share of the check ended up being around $40.

1468,Berkeley,2014-06-22,zep8PnkAY5IB2O7uDJXyBw,5, CA,"This is some great food, prepared thoughtfully and with care. Expensive but for a reason, and well worth the splurge. To start, an amazing cold fresh vegetable gazpacho thickened with ground almonds - brilliant!  We had very tender swordfish, deliciously seasoned. Swordfish is often mangled, cooked too long so it's tough. This was perfect. A thick crusty crabcake with capers and a little frisse on the side. An amazing salad with fat tender asparagus sliced lengthwise and topped with a slow-cooked soft poached egg - divine. The before-dinner Manhattan and whiskey sour were great! For dessert we had  a sort of deconstructed Key lime pie which had all the flavor of the traditional pie but was taken apart and arranged on the plate in a whimsical way. The only downside, which really did not diminish this great meal, was the slightly obsequious waiter. We were admittedly underdressed, coming from N.

1475,San Francisco,2009-01-26,ZE84jSa05rePI3Xlo5TaeA,3, CA,"To celebrate my 30th bday and the inauguration of our new president, we decided to come to Blue Duck Tavern for dinner after the rave reviews in Washingtonian Magazine (noted as top 100 restaurants in DC). I made reservations for 4, weeks ahead (they told me that they couldn't accommodate more than 4 or later than 6:15 so this place is pretty popular!) Located inside the Grand Hyatt right off the Foggy Bottom metro stop, the outside of the restaurant, with 2 dark wooden doors is not obvious to the eye if you are not looking out for it. Once inside, you feel transformed inside a warm rustic inn as you are greeted by an open kitchen with food being prepared right in front of you. The dining room has dark wooden tables and chairs with a nice wine cellar in the back. The entrees are ordered a la carte with sides to share. We had the Peppercorn steak, ribs, vegetable pie, salad, BDT fries, and baked beans. The highlights were the ribs which were really tender and basted in a light barbecue sauce. The BDT fries are their signature fries, steak cut, fried in duck fat, yes, it was deelish. The food and ambiance is perfect for a cold winter night, (I wonder if the place looks different for the summer?) We finished off our meal by sharing two desserts, a chocolate lava cake type dessert and the mango coconut custard. The desserts are huge and are definitely made to share. I'm a huge dessert fan and found that it was a little too sweet for my taste even though I had it with my itty bitty six dollar cappuccino. This place is definitely pricey. Because you can order so many things a la carte, it can get expensive. While I thought it was good, I would definitely say nothing to quack about =)",Betty C.

1477,Washington,2012-01-18,HPqrrWepLnldCOhLLZ1x1g,3, DC,"Great place for dinner, but only IF you have reservations. Once it was one of the few places in this end of town to have excellent food on short notice -- you could do it by sitting in the lounge area -- but now the lounge menu is severely restricted.I've been coming to Blue Duck for years; I usually sit in their little lounge area with a friend and have a bottle of wine and dinner. Since they don't have much seating in the dining room for small parties, it's often an hour or more wait to get a table for two. So I often recommend the lounge to friends. In the past, you could order decent food in the lounge area (not a bar, but rather a series of soft chairs with small tables for two - very quiet and pleasant, and it doesn't feel like a hotel restaurant at all). But they've unfortunately cut the menu back to only 7-8 options - a burger, mac and cheese, crabcakes, and several odd appetizers like bone marrow. It's a weirdly short list for a nice restaurant's lounge menu - there are no salads, low-cal, or vegan options at all. And they will not let you order off the dining menu unless you're a hotel guest. Recently I went straight from work (in a suit, for the record - I wasn't gross/inappropriate at all) to Blue Duck's lounge (we wanted a table, but the wait was 2 hours). I asked very nicely if I could get my favorite dish, the wonderful duck, to celebrate finishing a long week of work. I was told no. I had the waitress ask the manager nicely. No - plus a story about the kitchen being overwhelmed. Okay; that is their policy, fair enough. I ordered the $23 burger instead. It was not great, and certainly not worth $23. Then two gentlemen sat down next to me and were immediately handed the full dinner menu and wine menu, no questions asked. We all had a laugh about that, but let's be honest: as a resident of the district who will never be staying here, it just doesn't make sense to come to Blue Duck unless I have dining room reservations. Why should I order off a severely limited menu of second rate options, while the people sitting next to me get better service and better food? I might still come here for a bottle of wine or dessert, but not for dinner, unless I have reservations. The group of five that I recommended Blue Duck to a few months ago had exactly the same experience (I figured it was an off night), so I guess I should have known better. . . reservations only for this one from now on.",Jessica E.
1478,Arlington,2013-06-23,LqvH4exmjCxFZ3t8G4XKVA,4, VA,"The only thing keeping this review from having five stars is the absolutely overpriced wine list.  I recognized bottles on the list, and some had as much as a five times markup. Wines by the glass were just as ridiculous, with $10 per glass being charged for a bottle of wine that goes for eight dollars in the store.Okay, off my wine rant. On a sidenote, I did enjoy a berry caipirinha.We sat at a table near the kitchen, so we could observe a fair amount of the passline action.  The tables are fairly spread out, so I did not feel like I was crowded despite being near the kitchen.Service was top-notch here. Our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and did not try to push the most expensive things on the menu.Appetizers: we tried both the bone marrow ($16) and the seared foie gras ($18) appetizers.  Both were delicious, and the bone marrow was easily large enough to share with two people or more.Mains: we tried the suckling pig ($26) and the duck breast and confit leg ($29). I enjoyed the pig, but felt the skin could have been a bit crispier. The actual meat was very tender and delicious. As for the duck, the breast was sliced into five long strips. Four were cooked perfectly but the fifth was a bit overcooked, yet it was delicious nonetheless. I found the confit leg the most disappointing part of the night - It was dry, and actually only half of a leg.Sides: tried the famous BDT fries. Agree with others that these are probably overrated. They are more like very long potato wedges, than fries. I did not feel like they fully benefited from the duck fat. I would have preferred something skinnier and crispier.

Everything is a la carte, so we both ordered an appetizer, entree, and he ordered a starch side (their famous duck fat fries, which are pretty good (wouldn't call them amazing). He said his cauliflower soup was good (not amazing). My baby kale salad was savory and a little sweet and very good (if you're looking for a healthy start to compensate for the triple-fried duck fat fries and desserts, definitely go with the baby kale starter). I also had the roasted duck breast as my entree, which was really tender and flavorful. I skipped the starch/carb side (which all looked amazing) because I can't say my hips missed it...it seems like it would be pricy ordering everything a la carte here, but if you're having a salad, entree, wine (a rose du provence, which I loved), and a dessert, well, you get pretty full. Also, splitting a starch or a starter or a dessert is always an option, because it really becomes a lot of food quickly (and they family style everything). I had one or two of his duck fries, and I was completely satisfied as far as that goes (they are big). I ordered their signature apple pie for dessert, but actually the ice cream on the side (also something they're known for) was seriously the best I've ever had. Also, we got the carrot cake (which was complimentary because I leaked that it was his birthday-don't worry, no singing, just a little candle), which is a dome and also good...no apple pie though. If you have to choose one dessert to share because you're so full, get the apple pie, but I'd splurge on everything that you can fit in your stomach while you're there, because everything definitely seems like it has a lot of thought and heart put into it. Also, very friendly and attentive service; they definitely try to make you feel very welcomed and special. The End.",Steph S.

Specifically, he wait and host staff are overly friendly to the point where you want to slap them a little bit and yell ""treat me like a normal human being!"" The brunch started out with the trout appetizer. I would have never ordered it if Miriam hadn't insisted that it was the greatest thing ever. So we ordered it and it was amazing! There was a lot of it too, I think we weren't able to finish it. It's a bit salty and really full flavoured but oh-so-good. The table then shared the braised beef, chicken, crab cakes, sausage, grits, potatoes and a spinach-like veggie that was fantastic. Like I said, we ordered WAY more than we could possibly eat. But we couldn't help it, everything on the menu looked so amazing, and when we got the food, it didn't disappoint at all!I think the braised beef was a table favourite. It melted off the bone and in your mouth. It was full of flavour and incredibly tender. Amazing. The chicken was very well seasoned and put a new twist to chicken. You would think that you have had chicken every which way, but this was good stuff! Crab cakes... mmm crab cakes. They were juicy with huge lumps of crabs in them. Combine that with a great mixture of spices and you can imagine how these tingled the corners of your mouth. The sausage was interesting. It came with sauerkraut, which was very well done. Not the sweet American kind that you find, claiming to be German. So now we get to the surprise. The grits. I mean, I don't like grits. They suck ass. They taste like cardboard and whatever you decide to put in it. I never saw the point in eating them. When Miriam ordered the grits, I have her a look. It was the ""I don't think I want to be associated with you anymore"" look. But then the grits came out. They were amazing. They were a combination of garlic, oil and butter. It has a yellow tint and the oil was swimming on the top of it. It was full of flavour and tasted nothing of the crap you get elsewhere. I actually wanted more. It was pure comfort food. I was converted. For dessert, we had apple pie. It was amazing. It came with ice cream that came in a frosted vat and was served with a wooden cooking spoon. One thing I thought was cool that they didn't scoff when we said we wanted to take the leftovers home. There was enough to feed my father and me again for lunch the next day and be totally satisfied. They packed the things up and the food was waiting for us at the door. Obviously, this was a fantastic food experience and I can't wait for my next trip to DC to do this all over again!",Mariko F.
1486,San Francisco,2008-07-25,PihJsX7CBjA9cwY_TjlBIg,2, CA,"WORST! SERVICE! EVER!Wow - I am utterly shocked by these high reviews. Our experience was pretty awful. Well, actually, the ambiance is really nice, and the food was pretty good. Normally I would probably go for 4 stars. But, the service was a DISASTER.1) I made a reservation the day before. I indicated to the host that we would be 3 adults, 2 children. All they had available was 6 or 9:30 pm, which was interesting because the place was 1/2 empty while we were there from 6-8:30 pm.2) We arrived. The restaurant was mostly empty. They sat us in a remote corner at a huge table isolated from the entire restaurant. The host faulted us for saying we were 5 adults when we called, which was not true. (They later contradicted themselves by saying that ""5 is the magic number - it you have five there is nowhere to sit b/c Hyatt policy doesn't allow you to change the architecture of the room"")3) We asked to be moved to the main dining room. The manager came - condescending as Hell - and offered to move us outside to the 90 degree heat. We insisted NO, and he pressed us to the point where it was uncomfortable. He kept on reiterating that is all he could do for us and acted like he was bending over backward to put us at a 4-seater in the sweltering heat, whilst half the restaurant and patio were empty.4) We ordered a variety of appetizers and dinners.5) About 20 minutes later, we received one small appetizer of tomatoes.6) About 40 minutes elapsed without any contact with waitstaff. I was upset, and sought the condescending manager's attention.7) The condescending manager came over like we were crazy b/c nobody had acknowledged us in our little isolated corner for 40 minutes and told us this is how long the food takes to come to the table normally. It took another 15 minutes for the food to actually come. This 40-55 minute preparation time is bunk because another asst. manager came over and apologized because the kitchen was swamped. We also saw multiple parties come and go in the time that we waited.8) The food was pretty good, especially the wild salmon and swiss chard, and scallops. The market fish (some kind of sea bass) was everybody's least fave - in that it was simultaneously bland and fishy. However, to give Caesar what belongs to Caesar, in general, the food was fresh, tasty, and seasoned well.Though we were visibly irked by the terrible service, and made it known numerous times, the staff made absolutely no concession.  My sister felt bad about giving only a 15% tip, which I insisted on. Though she then realized that she had no idea who our waiter was. I will not go back if I can help it. That is, until that AWFUL condescending manager gets fired. He truly is awful.",Andrew K.
1487,New York,2014-12-28,WgiHQb7TsV5ZFC7fxYmyfA,4, NY,"Came here for lunch on a thursday in late December. My friend was late, so I ordered the lavender tea while waiting, which the waitress aptly described as tasting the way that ""bubble baths feel"". Was amused to find a $300+ tea on the menu that was apparently 5 years in the making as it was negotiated for, then carried out of china by hand --so so curious... but just not quite curious enough ;) I ordered the braised beef rib, while my friend got the pumpkin tortelli; we share the hand cut fries and sunchokes (special vegetable side of the day).  The beef rib was so tender, i didnt need a knife to separate it. While the texture was awesome, the flavour was merely good --it tasted like the beef was braised in nothing but its own juices...it was a little too uniform in flavour for such a large piece. My friend, who is a repeat diner here, is obsessed with the fries. One potato probably makes four of these fries, they are so wide --a little too wide if you're a fan of crispy fries. Would definitely come again happily, but for these reasons, i'm giving it a four instead of a five. would give the ambiance (lots of blond wood) a 5 and the service a 5 as well.",Cara H.

Just okay, definitely dry, but lacked real flavor. I've had far better $22 burgers! Duck fries were alright--unique, I guess ($10). Ice tea was good. Hostess seemed annoyed that we walked in, and server was less than friendly. All in all, I find no compelling reason to return. Not sure what the hype is all about! For the prices, I've experienced far better food and service!",Mike J.
1490,Vienna,2013-11-09,omKKlu6hk8n6wiQW-Uz2uw,5, VA,Nice place for our anniversary.  I liked the thought put into the food presentation.  We had the foie gras and bone marrow for starters which certainly met our expectations.,Terrence G.
1491,Dupont Circle,2014-02-17,sam9_XPTyxFyKkBw33r1aA,3, Washingto,I live near by and it was high on my list to visit based on reviews. The food was good and service was fine. The thing that bothered me was how close we were to the tables on both sides. I would recommend for such a high end place to not pack-'em in there. We left early so that we could stop shouting over the girls beside us.,Tiffany L.
1492,Woodland Hills,2015-06-12,v6AQ8YtaEsMmTHngp_l_tw,3, CA,"Terrific service at this hotel restaurant. The wine selection is particularly good. The weakness was the food.

1493,Quincy,2014-04-28,i9KshUJK7jIbkXG_XJ2ESA,4, MA,"We have been wanting to try the Blue Duck Tavern and finally made it for brunch.  The food was really great!!  We started off with mimosas and bloody marys, and they were very nicely done.  Then we had the house smoked salmon, pastrami, and deviled eggs.  I'm actually not sure where the pastrami came into play on the board, but the smoked salmon was interesting - it was dressed with a sweet balsamic vinegar.  I was not expected the sweetness, but I think it worked.  My bf had the eggs benedict, and he liked it, but was not overly impressed.  I had the short rib hash, and it was so, so, so good.  I was sad when I had finished it all.  We really enjoyed the dining room itself.  We sat in the seats along the windows facing M St, and it was very well lit and cheery with all of the natural light spilling in.  Being in that part of the restaurant also makes dining a little more quiet than the open dining room area in the middle.  The furniture choices (lots of light and medium woods) worked well with the overall tone of the restaurant.  It was a like a modern stately, but not pretentious or stuffy.The service was good, but definitely not the hovering type.  The staff is definitely there to address any needs, but for instance, if you would like a refill of coffee, you have to ask because it will not be refilled automatically.  However, that makes for a very nice, leisurely brunching experience.",B P.

The service is impeccable - the waiters seem to feel, when you need them, and they are definitely not there, when you just want some peace to enjoy the delicious food. The restaurant is lively, but not too noisy, so it's a great setting if you actually want to have a conversation. It's hard to find a parking spot nearby, but that's true for DC in general. All in all, a perfect place for dinning in style.",Ana S.
1497,Washington,2013-03-29,pGillLCiku3bHoa5Z6tq7g,2, DC,"We had friends from out of town who had heard of BDT through some magazine and wanted to go. My partner and I had been here before recently and enjoyed it so we thought that it was a good idea. Unfortunately, we did not experience the consistency you would expect of this restaurant.The food was ok, but smaller portions than I remember from last time. I remember their banana s'mores from last time being amazing and we ordered it again this time and it was not the same. It had zero milk chocolate on it. Tasted much more like caramel, which was disappointing.The service, however, was horrible. Our waiter didn't even introduce himself to the table once we were all seated. I believe it was Michael, tall shaved head gentleman, (and only think that because the hostess said he would be serving us). Michael acted like he had zero time to wait on our table and was too good to be a waiter. He managed to bring me two items that I didn't order instead of what I actually ordered. And on the first one even disagreed with me. Which, I'm sorry, but even if he was right, which he wasn't, at these prices you agree with the customer. The second item he brought me the wrong salad I ordered and I didn't get the right one until everyone else at the table had already finished theres. I was completely unimpressed by the service and the restaurant wasn't even at full capacity. Overall I think this restaurant has gotten way overrated. You can find much better places for the same price with consistency",Scott J.
1498,Washington,2012-10-02,0ZB5SotVKJazmXJ-pi5RaA,5, DC,"Went with a group of burgundy lovers to Blue Duck and I think even the burgundy was impressed. Achieved several perfect pairings with some great help from the sommelier, Gene, who was as generous with glassware as his time.  The sweetbreads and marrow were decadent choices that delivered, but the grits really threw me back in my seat, and I was already bolted in quite tight after the perfectly executed duck breast medallions.  The only knock I could even come up with was that the sauteed mushrooms were a little salty, but when I mentioned it, my friends shouted me down and asked for more for themselves. I was probably wrong.  Great meal. Thanks for accommodating us.",Ian L.
1499,Arlington,2010-05-31,qlRoGG1yTipzzc_SGRChKg,4, VA,"The dining area is unquestionably nice, but I don't understand why so many people consider it the nicest dining space in the city. Maybe these people consider the Park Hyatt the nicest hotel? I also think it's a little unhygienic some of the various stations are so accessible to patrons. Anyone walking to or leaving the restrooms could easily sneeze on or defile the ingredients and desserts sitting at the pastry station.  The service here is immaculate. Our server was as professional as they come and even communicated directly with the chef a number of times for some off menu requests. They also had a beverage wench whose sole purpose was to ensure our glasses were no more than a quarter empty. I thought this was actually obnoxious, as my company and I found ourselves halting private conversations every five minutes to let this person top off our already full drinks. We deferred completely to our server for recommendations. Started out with the pheasant consommé, which we were told took four days to prepare. I appreciated the clarified, intense flavor of the soup, but to me it was too bitter. For this reason,  I don't think I'd order this again. Next was the infamous oven roasted bone marrow. The overall dish was good, but the marrow itself was bland. I found myself consistently using the sea salt and wondering if it could've been roasted slightly longer. As far as flavor, I thought the roasted garlic was the highlight of the dish.For main courses, we ordered the Muscovy duck breast and braised beef rib. With respect to portion size, I'm not sure what's family-style about the dishes other than the fact that they're served with tongs. The duck was very flavorful, but tasted as if it was seasoned with too much smoke extract. On top of that two of the five pieces were chewy. The braised beef with homemade steak sauce was also very flavorful, but as far as the beef, contrary to other Yelp reviews, it was nowhere near tender enough to cut with a fork. Don't get me wrong, both of the dishes were really good, but I couldn't help but feel they weren't worth the prices. The polenta with mushrooms was money.For dessert we passed on their recommendation of apple pie and opted for the ginger custard and exotic sorbet. The custard was a little strange, but decent.  The sorbet was incredible. After espressos, the tab came out to around $100 per person with no alcohol. Overall, the service, atmosphere, flavors, and preparation of food here is hard to find in a lot of places in the area.  After a couple more visits and a better handle on their menu, I think this place definitely has potential to become one of my more favorite restaurants.",Paul W.
1500,Washington,2011-06-17,bhqlbhAs0ae4asg0nBGEsw,5, DC,"I've dined at Blue Duck on two occasions, and both were truly memorable.The first was the first time I ever tried bone marrow.  I guess any piece of pure fat should taste good, but the way Blue Duck prepares it is really delectable.  I do not feel as if I am eating a piece of pure fat, I'm eating something really tasty, instead.I've gotten the whole fish of the day on both occasions.  I love that they can debone it for you.  They were well-cooked and well seasoned, but probably not the most adventurous or truly outstanding item on the menu.The beef short ribs, however, truly stand out.  I believe they are braised for 18 hours.  The flavor is the best briskety flavor I've tasted.  And like everyone says, the meat falls right off the bone and melts in your mouth.I also loved the beet salad.  Maybe just cause I love beets.  But these beets were nicely dressed.  The carrots were pulled fresh from the ground that morning.  They tasted like earth.  Scallops, gnocchi, mashed potatoes, asparagus - all great.  The parsnips tasted a bit too much like horseradish for my taste, but I do not know if that is the flavor of a parsnip or of how they were prepared as I've never had them before.Dessert is also outstanding.  My favorite was the strawberry and rhubarb pie.  The strawberries were the freshest I've ever tasted in a pie.  Everyone loved the banana s'more dessert.  The cinnamon chocolate ice cream was really yummy too.  Why aren't those two items put together more often??  A word on the decor, ambience, service.  Service is outstanding.  You are introduced to the two people who will be serving you that night.  Every service of dishes is coordinated and timed - all appetizers are placed in front of each person at the same time.  There is no rush to get through your food or leave your table.  We had a 6 pm reservation and didn't leave until 9 pm.  I love that the kitchen is open for all diners to view.  You know there is nothing foul going on back there, and that there is a true love and attention to detail, and focus in the food preparation.My one complaint: why is it so hard to get a reservation at a normal hour?  The two times I've been, my reservations have been so early - 6 pm and 5:45 pm.  Why so early?  The restaurant felt pretty empty the entire time I was there.  So where are all the tables? For whom are they being saved?  Can I walk in instead??Anyway, this place is really well done.  I left feeling totally satisfied and full, but not in a way that I ate things that are so so bad for me.  Instead, it was a feeling of pure satisfaction.",Martha G.

Not too sweet or overpowering.  Would go back to try the breakfast and have the dessert again.",Rachel J.

1504,Bethesda,2010-08-27,FR1cQO2sRCrVC3RZK_3oTA,5, MD,"What an incredible DC Restaurant Week lunch!  It was fantastic deal--the equivalent to a full dinner at nearly ~1/3 of the cost!  The 3-course lunch included a sizable side dish that came with the entrées.  While no single dish was extraordinary, my dining companion and I were impressed by the consistency throughout every dish--all of them were great and we could not pick one over another.  Add in the woodsy, natural ambiance and professional, friendly service, we had a truly wonderful all-around experience.Initially, I was interested in going to Blue Duck Tavern having read about the rave reviews and because it was one of the most expensive restaurants participating in DC RW.  As soon as we arrived at our tables, we knew the experience was going to be very positive: the entire lunch menu was restaurant week and no prices were listed for the appetizer/entrée/dessert selections.  This showed us that Chef Brian McBride and his team put forth their whole-hearted efforts to utilize the event as a way of attracting customers rather than making patrons feel cheap.For starters, we ordered Roasted Maine Scallops with Watercress-like greens, Hazelnut and Brown Butter as well as Heirloom Tomatoes with Sheep's Milk Ricotta, Baby Coconut, and Solera Vinaigrette.  Although the scallops were cooked through, they were tender, pretty (catchy white foam as part of presentation), and very substantial (3 huge scallops).  Matching this heartiness were the refreshing tomatoes: naturally sweet, lightly tart, and savory with a lightly sweet coconut-ricotta topping.For entrée, we ordered their signature Braised Beef Rib with Homemade Steak Sauce and Peppercorn Seared Rare Tuna with Local Beans, 6-Minute Egg, and Rosemary Ginger Vinaigrette.  For sides, we could not miss Baby Beets with Candied Orange Peel and Marcona Almonds plus their signature Triple Fries with garlicky mayo.  The tuna was well-composed and balanced when all components were eaten together (the egg was prepared perfectly medium-rare), while the beef was tender, rich, and herby.  The sides matched wonderfully as their preparation of the beets, which may normally have been a bit too tart on their own, balanced the richness of the beef and the heartiness of the fries as well as providing a nice dipping sauce for the tuna and fries.  The entrées may have been a bit smallish, but the ample size of the sides made overall portions plentiful.For dessert, we decided to try the Apple Pie for two since we rarely order pie for dessert and since the adjacent table's order looked stunning.  The dessert was literally a full-sized pie--enough for four to share after a hearty meal as we had enjoyed thus far.  We decided to savor the pie by cutting it half and taking half to-go.  The pie shell was buttery, rich, and flaky with a lightly glazed topping while the apples were creamy, tart, and lightly cinnamony.  The shape of the pie was narrower but taller, which made it moister at the core and more eye-catching than the usual flatter variety.  The pie paired nicely with a frothy-topped coffee--tasty and not too strong.Blue Duck Tavern is definitely on my very short list of go-to restaurants for DC RW (along with Tosca for dinner).  While we favor normally New American over places that call themselves upscale ""American,"" we had an absolute ball at BDT--an outstanding restaurant for foodies and maybe one of the best places for those who enjoy sharing (which they encourage for every dish) nicely-sourced, well-executed, fancy takes on homey Western comfort food.  The service is friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and well-coordinate, and the ambiance is a nice contrast of natural light (for lunch), dark and light woods.  Overall, BDT is an outstanding dining experience and an especially tremendous deal for DC RW!",Mickey L.

We had been there one other time for my birthday and this restaurant sets the standard for top notch dining in DC. We arrived early to have a drink at the bar, and the service was impeccable. When we went to check on our table at the time of our reservation the hostess said she was waiting on a special table, (knowing it was our anniversary) and apologized for the slight delay with two complimentary glasses of champage. That was impressive. We were seated shortly thereafter in the kitchen area so you can watch the chefs making meals. It's such a fun concept and very entertaining! Dinner was amazing. We started with the heirloom tomato and summer butter crunch salads, followed by the main course of the braised beed rib and the roasted suckling pig with the BDT triple fries and sauteed wild mushrooms.

We were seating outside with no umbrella on top of us to prevent the rain.

1509,Manhattan,2011-07-11,_i7AWLXKHwCRoJNkOybRUQ,4, NY,"I found this a really good place. There are two entrances, the outside one and the inside hotel one. I stayed at the Park Hyatt (check my review) The entrance from the hotel to the Blue Duck Tavern is very original, you walk through the table of bread, the waiters are preparing their stuff as you walk in, that's good feng shui, it gives you another sensation.   This was one of the best places we ate in DC. Their cuisine is american, nouvelle. The difference here is that they serve you good portions of food, not just a tasting concept.   I ate the lobster salad, it was really good, i recommend it, and the hamachi... It was ok, the cooking of it was interesting, but i wouldn't ask for it again.    My friend ate the chicken, which was very abundant, and as a side dish we had the corn, it was simply delicious. They want you to try all their ingredients together, that way you will have a superb meal!   This is a popular place, i read that president Obama used to eat here.   The open kitchen concept is great,  the service was impeccable, very kind people. I loved the way they treat us, so educated, so polite. A special recognition to the staff. This place won its four stars without trouble, it's consistent and solid.",Samuel M.

1511,Washington,2010-07-18,K8iWfwQ8hoGXG8SEUor3Ag,4, DC,"Almost everyone who's been to Blue Duck Tavern said good things about it. I visited BDT for brunch, first thing first the parking situation with no coins at the meter, I ran into the restaurant and asked them for change, the staff were extremely helpful and made sure I got the change I needed. When we walked in to the restaurant, there were several staff ready to host us, they were very polite and friendly letting us know we had a window seat. We ordered the Egg Benedict with a pheasant crepinette, the croque madam and some pork sausages. My companion recommended the fresh squeezed orange juice, it was $5 in a tiny glass however I found later it was refillable! I ended up having about 3-4 glasses it was so refreshing for a hot day.We sat overlooking the water fountain with little birds frolicking, buttering our bread and even ordered some coffee while waiting. Not before long, we realized that 45 min had passed and we were not served our food. Our 1 hr meter was running out of time. Two tables down, a group of four that came later than us, were served their appetizers following the entrees. The waiter who took our order was no where to be found. My companion was getting upset as it was getting close to 2 PM. We alerted the waitress and before we knew it, we were served some fresh croissant we didnt order, he said it was complimentary of the BDT. The manager appeared shortly explaining to us there was a miscommunication and our order had not be put in?! He apologized profusely and told us they had failed to deliver the service and food hence taking full responsibility for the blunder. The entire brunch was complimentary. Like Yelper Jack F. said, they came out in full force when serving the food - about 3-4 waiters came with food in their hands. Our egg benedict, croque madam minus the pork sausages but they served us an order of the beef short ribs hash. In addition, they served us a light and refreshing cocktail. While we were eating, another manager came out to apologize to us and told us he would like us to have some desserts on the house. Since we were getting full, we declined the dessert but he insisted that we take a couple of the apple pies home with us. They made it up for the delay just about 2-3 times over with all the additional items, we felt touched by that. We left some tip on the table and were getting ready to leave, the waitress came out with yet another platter of fresh waffles and three flavors of ice-creams. The waffles and ice-creams were delicious!! The waitress also delivered a bag with two boxes of full size apple pies for us to take home. Overall, the quality of the food was fantastic - absolutely no doubt how good the food was at BDT. The service was strange - I guess I did not expect this type of service at an American restaurant, full-on attention and multi-staff running around for you making you like you were a VIP. For the order mistake, they definitely more than made it up, however there was no excuse for not paying attention if a table was not served an egg benedict after 1 hr especially with the number of staff. We were joking that they had to run to the farms for the fresh eggs.",Nicole L.

I also loved the open kitchen, the service and the delicious food.The ambiance was also quiet and intimate during lunch with was pretty unique for this area.

1515,Silver Spring,2016-02-12,YValHncIYSWQkchM-pIV8g,2, MD,"I've been to the Blue Duck a few times, but last night was the last. I'm a vegetarian, and the pumpkin cavatelli--the only real dinner option for me--was sweet and bland, without anything astringent or salty or sharp to balance out the flavors of gourd and ricotta. For dessert, I ordered the cranberry-pear buckle, which again lacked piquancy. After rifling through it for berries, I uncovered about five. The rest of it consisted of bland, sweet pear slices in bland, sweet vanilla cake with a scoop of bland, sweet ice cream on top. For this dinner I paid $50. I didn't have a reservation and so sat in the bar area, which was rendered unnecessarily uncomfortable by tables that have drawers that extend down the sides, which means that you can either sit far from the table with your knees jammed up against the wood, or you can sit in a spread-eagle position to eat your $50 meal. My waitress was of uncaring Teutonic stock and, while competent, did nothing to warm me to my meal on a freezing night.",Lauren H.
1516,Pelham,2008-05-15,4XVuZIpqfrkKd4pgh62RUw,5, NY,"For Mother's Day Brunch, my parents, my boyfriend, and his mom went to the Blue Duck Tavern.  Now, I should have called to find out how expensive the Mother's Day Brunch was but I didn't even think of it!  So we sit down and the waiter tells us it is $80/person! I guess these nice restaurants have price-fixed brunches which makes sense and they know they can charge an arm and a leg for them!There was a buffet of cold things for before the entre and a dessert buffet for after our entre. My dad and my boyfriend's mom ate their weight in cocktail shrimp.  I ate a chocolate croissant, lots of melons, pineapple, strawberries.  The desserts looked amazing but I don't like cheesecake and I got some chocolate cake but it turned out to be hazelnut which I am allergic to so I didn't eat it.  The men (my dad and Mike) ordered the filet mignon as their entree.  The moms ordered other meat type things and I ordered the salmon.  We ordered one of every side they offered which included grits, mashed potatoes and fingerling fries or whatever those are called.  All the sides were put in the center for us to share family style.  It was craziness.  We all ordered coffee and they brought five individual coffee pots!   The moms got mimosas which were like 90% champagne, 10% OJ so they were enjoying themselves. Each bathroom stall was its own little bathroom! It had a sink, mirror, toilet, etc.  So fancy.  My boyfriend and my dad split the bill which reminded me how awesome it is to have your father in town and a wonderful and generous boyfriend!  Definitely the most expensive meal I have ever eaten but I think when I am a bit older and have money to spare this is the type of place I will always take my mom to for Mother's Day brunch.  On the way out they gave a rose to every Mom!",Jess K.

Why do drugs when you have this dessert??????The only reason I didn't give it five stars was the ambience and service.  I appreciated the cleanness and impeccable style of the restaurant, but I felt like a commoner in a palace.  When I placed my bag on the floor, a waiter rushed over with a stool.  It wasn't like anyone was rude, but I felt just a little out-of-place.  Contributing to that feeling were the prices (which were totally worth it, but still, it's expensive).  I ended up ordering the cheapest thing on the menu because I wasn't paying and I'm just self-conscious like that.But feeling out of place and high prices is absolutely no reason not to dine here.  I would welcome elitism and going bankrupt if it meant eating food from Blue Duck every day of the week.

We had made reservations and were seated promptly at a table in a glass enclosure which made it feel like we had our own room. We ordered coffee and pineapple-mint juice and pomegranate-orange juice. Coffee came a little bit later than the fresh squeezed juices but it was ok. Our server was attentive and apologetic regarding the delays in the serving. We ordered some pecan buns, and short rib hash, wagyu teres major steak and eggs, fried chicken and waffles and some BDT triple fries. Everything was exceptionally good. Short rib hash was tangy with the onions and the horseradish sauce gave it the right amount of kick. Fried chicken was fried to a perfection that you could hear the crispiness of the skin from the other side of the table. Wagyu was so succulent that I wanted to order some extra even though I was stuffed. And the pecan sticky buns, two per order, was so light and fluffy that it was hard to believe it was possible to bake them that way. At the end of our brunch our server surprised us with one of their famous applepies and some vanilla ice-cream to celebrate our 13th anniversary. The whole experience was so great that I am already making plans to go back. Highly recommended.",Sierra T.

My friend and I are from AZ and were given great recommendations. BDT was one of them. The restaurant was beautifully lit and decorated. Right when you walk in, your senses are hit immediately by the desserts just a few feet away. We were seated by the cute french host and ordered wine, oysters to start, I ordered the vegetarian risotto and my friend ordered the crispy skinned salmon with bacon and clam chowder. Everything was cooked to perfection. My rissoto had squash, pears and the perfect amount of cheesy goodness. Her clam chowder wasn't too thick or thin and had the right amount of clams. The salmon was divine. I kept picking off her plate! We could not pass up on the apple tart. We were told by our attentive waiter that this was President Obama's favorite apple dessert. Uh, I was sold. BEST APPLE TART EEVVVVVEEERRR!! The honey vanilla crispy top was borderline orgasmic. I was so happy. We were in foodie heaven. Between the 2 of us it was around $100.

The hostess was (understandably) a bit cool when we asked for a table for 7 in the dining room (at 7:00pm). However, the staff in the lounge went way out of their way to make us comfortable there. They brought us the dining room menus and served us a full meal. The food was excellent - the THICK fries were unlike anything I've had before - and we enjoyed a variety of more unusual fare, such as seared foie gras, that we don't normally have.

The Bratwurst had amazing texture and consistency and was also quite delicious.  (Did I mention the portions are large?  Make sure to come hungry!)  The Arugula Salad was delectable... I loved the tangy lemon vinaigrette and the asparagus was quite delicious.  It tasted as though it was sauteed in olive oil and garlic with another flavor that made it so crunchy and delicious.  I can't speak for the potato salad but I know my fiance enjoyed it!Our server Adam and his co-server were wonderful.  Adam answered all of our questions and made lovely recommendations for our meal.  I was surprised by a dessert (that arrived in flames!) consisting of angel food cake, vanilla & strawberry ice cream, and Grand Marnier (topped with fresh strawverries!).  It was AMAZING!  My fiance must have secretly told them it was my birthday because it was executed so wonderfully.  I was very surprised.The staff was extremely hospitable and we felt as though they really enjoyed us dining with them last night.  Nathaniel (Nate) was also outstanding.Thanks, Blue Duck Tavern, for such a wonderful dining experience on my birthday.  We had such a great time and cannot wait to join you again soon.  Until then, I will dream about the Ribs...",Monika H.
1543,Denver,2011-06-28,r0548q6lunuo6P_aaRSvTA,5, CO,"My wife and I went to Blue Duck Tavern for the first time in June 2011 while visiting DC.  Friends of ours who lived in DC highly recommended it, so we gave it a try.  We were extremely impressed with this place, so I am taking the time to describe everything.First off, this place is beautiful.  Its kitchen and pantry are open to view and create a very homey atmosphere.  They have beautiful, classic furniture and don't hide it with white table clothes and such.  We sat right near the kitchen and we got to see them putting the final touches on every dish that went out.  That alone was amazing.Then came the food....again, extremely impressed.  We started with a Roasted Beet Salad with endive, apples, walnuts, and Humbolt Fog Goat Cheese.  It was very simple and straightforward but amazing.  For our entrees we split the Orange Ale Braised Rabbit with Artichoke and Slab Bacon and the Wood Burning Over Roasted Maine Scallops, with Lemon and Tyme.  This was my first true experience with rabbit and I absolutely loved it.  It was very tender and juicy and tasted simply amazing.  The bacon added just the right amount of smoke to it and the artichoke complimented the earthlyness of the rabbit and bacon well.  This is one that I will definitely go back for next time I'm in DC.  The scallops were simple and elegant....cooked to perfection.  They actually only seared them on one side....something that might be my new standard for cooking scallops. We ordered a side of golden rice that was good, but paled in comparison to the rest of the meal.  We also got the Roasted Green Asparagus with Duckegg Bernaise and Duck Prosciutto.  I pretty much HATE asparagus, but this was actually quite good.For dessert we were waffling between the Chocolate Cake with Maker's Mark Flambe and the Apple Pie.  We ordered the cake but they brought us the apple pie on the house, which definitely scored some points with us.  Both were very solid.Lastly, the service was impecible.  We basically had a primary and secondary waiter so we were very well taken care of.  Both checked in regularly and made sure every detail was perfect.  They made excellent suggestions on wine and the extra dessert was really a cherry on top.If you are looking for fine dining in the DC area, I highly recommend the Blue Duck Tavern!We",Dan M.

In the past I have enjoyed the bratwurst with a truly one-of-a-kind homemade mustard and sauerkraut on the side.  (There may have been a mustard sampler, come to think of it.)  The entrees are simple and their marinades and sides are a bit more earthy than my usual preference but I think the simplicity is what makes their food so good.  If bone marrow is your thing, they serve that too!As I mentioned at the get-go, their desert is a singularly pleasurable experience.  If you go with a group, make sure that everyone saves room so that you can sample as many of their homemade deserts as possible.  The personal apple pie is just that: a full pie/crust and all.  The Strawberry rhubarb is an old-fashioned ""grandma"" dish made chic that I cant help but love.  Their bar area is not my favorite but its quiet and private.  The decor is tasteful and french/country modern.

This is up there with the best food in Washington at least, and would contend strongly for best high-end American nation wide. Oh, and the service was absolutely the best I've had in a really long time.We shared two entrees and sides, since we just wanted to sample as much of the menu as we could. We had the duck, which was perfectly cooked and flavored expertly, and the trout, which was also extremely well done. We had no room for dessert, but they had baked fresh apple pies that smelled SO GOOD when we walked in. This is an expensive restaurant but delivers for each dollar you spend. I am going to tell my family about this place, and I'm definitely going to come back.",L Z.

1549,Washington,2015-12-20,kYNhkPolMI4Msixl0YO5mQ,2, DC,"Completely overrated.  I've been here a few times and never been that impressed.  This most recent time we arrived at 12:30 for a business lunch for four people.  The restaurant was busy but not overly so.  There are a lot of service people bustling about -- I think there were three women to check us in, take our coats and give us stools for our purses.  So I don't understand why the service is so totally off.  It took a full half hour for our starters to arrive -- mostly salads since the soup of the day was already sold out (strange so early we thought).  Then we waited and waited for our entrees.  At about 1:25 I called over the server and explained we needed to get back to the office for a 2:00 meeting and needed to leave at 1:50 at the latest.  She said ""perfect"" which is an odd response.  Our entrees the did come but it took so long that three of us went to the meeting leaving one person back to settle the check.  The food was fine -- but nothing life changing.  And slow service is just stressful.   They need to focus on the fundamentals -- my purse doesn't really need a stool.",Shieldmaiden P.
1550,Alexandria,2011-04-20,Ha1Z71p1X8DPvl69bYtH2A,2, VA,"The Blue Duck is on many ""Best of"" lists for brunch. Ambiance was very nice, whole place has a country yet contemporary feel. I was a bit confused entering the restaurant from the hotel, you walk through the kitchen. The entrance and open kitchen made for a bit of novelty to the spot. Study menu, look, look,... sigh. Nothing stands out though the waiter was helpful in further describing the dishes. Ok this, this and that... We started with the recommended croissant and jams; croissants were tasty, fresh and warm, but nothing special, jams may as well have been Smuckers, again just ok. I ordered a shrimp and egg dish; presentation, think a plate with a 6"" X"" 6"", 3/4"" thick hash brown cube sitting on it. Waiter failed to mention the cube thing. The eggs came in a side container that reminded me of those small metallic coffee crème containers. The waiter opened the container, scooped some eggs atop the cube. Voila! Swear I heard a faint Nelson ""Haa Ha"" (The Simpsons) over my shoulder from another table. The egg-shrimp concoction, in a creamy red curry-ish sauce, was tasty yet very light on shrimp. This dish would not get the chef to round two on any cooking competition show.My companion ordered the steak and eggs. I'm not a big meat eater but the presentation was a lot better--silver skillet with a cut of beef that looked like a mini prime rib, 6-8 medallions 2"" in diameter, cooked perfectly. Eggs came sunny side, glad it wasn't mine b/c I hate undone yokes =P . Only issue is that they brought a side plate we assumed to move the food from the skillet. Unfortunately the utensils made that maneuver with the eggs impossible, the effort was admirable, she decided to smash right from the skillet *shrug*. I tasted the steak, very tasty. Oh there was also an orange sized garlic thing on the skillet, not sure if it was edible but glad she didnt try.Scratched this place off my list. Glad I went, not glad at how much I spent for an overall hum, hum experience. 2 drinks, 2 entrees, 1 appetizer, C-note w/ tip. Hear that ""companion""!! Probably won't go back; Been there, Done that.",Shannon E.
1551,Fairfax,2006-12-05,F41LRfdyzj4yagcDVsIS7g,4, VA,"I guess the ""Tavern"" in the name refers to the food being served in casserole dishes. Or maybe the apple pies on the counter. No matter, because I really didn't find much tavern about this place. Huge windows? Well, the place does have the tavern-ish dark tables.After noticing the open kitchen, we sit down. Looking at the menu, I discover some of the meat and produce used here is brought in from Pennsylvania of all places. And other items are from local farms, and still others are from farms across the nation. From the descriptions of the offerings, we learn that the chefs are big on using fire in their cooking---all dishes seem to be either wood roasted, braised or cooked slowly over flame.With apologies to Donald, I had the soft-shell crab. It seemed inappropriate not to have at a place with ""duck"" in its name. But I went against the grain. It was deliciously crispy. We followed up dinner with dessert of ice cream made in house and bourbon flambeed chocolate cake.  Go here just for the strawberry ice cream -- I implore you",Gayle G.

I want both a sense of contentedness and accomplishment. This restaurant did not disappoint. Everything was impeccably cooked and presented with a great deal of thought put into flavor pairings. The wait staff was attentive and informative, but not once intrusive. I had the apple pie for desert, and you get nearly a whole ""personal sized"" apple tart. It was nearly perfection.

1554,Washington,2011-04-10,mRYQNWBv4Zwd0uVuvpZu5g,2, DC,"I was soooo looking forward to finally eating at Blue Duck Tavern.   My partner and I were excited to bring his dad and stepmom who was visiting us this weekend to the Tavern.   We made reservations for brunch on Sunday morning.   We had a brief tease of it's potential when we met them at their arrival in DC on Thursday night for a cocktail and dessert.   The decor is all brown and tan - and cozy.  We sat at the bar with excellent cocktails and sharing two desserts.   A cherry pie with vanilla and espresso ice cream - all home made.  It was delicious though quite expensive.Then came Sunday morning, and we were sadly disappointed.  The restaurant is awesome though with an open kitchen and attentive and apologetic staff.   We started with fresh oysters that oddly tasted like that bad smell of the sea - and hopefully they weren't bad (fingers crossed).  It definitely left a bad taste in our mouth.   The bread and the croissants and jam were just okay - nothing to rave about.   I ordered sunnyside up eggs over cod cakes and spicy buttermilk sauce - and the cakes were very fishy tasting.  And because of the bad oysters, I couldn't eat it.   My partner's egg benedict with sausage was a small plate - and he thought it was okay but could have been tastier.   And the parents had roasted potatoes and scrambled eggs with shrimp.  The potatoes were kind of boring - but they enjoyed the eggs and shrimp.Overall - the price of our brunch was about for 4 people was $150k not including tip ....... and we were underwhelmed.  I also couldn't eat my dish - of course I should have expected the possibility of fishy tasting cod cakes before ordering it but didn't expect the taste of the bad oysters to influence my low tolerance for more fishy food.  And I couldn't eat it.    Doubtful that I will go back - but perhaps to sit at the bar for a drink and some dessert.",Bob B.

1559,New York,2010-12-16,HM01ik0wvJbbi27OxVWeEg,4, NY,"I thought i would be giving this place 5 stars after reading all the reviews but my overall experience fell just a little short from perfect (perhaps my expectations were too high?) In any case, a good, solid 4 stars. HIGHLIGHTs: - the complimentary warm pistachios while waiting at the bar for our table (i've never had pistachios served this way before- it added a nice touch.) - our braised lamb belly appetizer:  two juicy slices of meat that weren't too fatty. I liked that there wasn't just a piece of fat on our plate, and although i'm a firm believer that fat makes the dish sinfully tastier, it was nice to have a litttle less.  - CRABCAKES. Highly recommend. You won't be disappointed. AND the DUCK CONFIT ""MAC N' CHEESE"". - portions are sized for you to have an appetizer, entree, sides and dessert (some restaurants over-size the portions that you sometimes can't make it to dessert). I would have normally complained about the portions here, since each individual dish isn't very large. But if you think about all the different things you get to try, you'll end up feeling very, very full by the end. - can't help but order two desserts: at BDT, you will likely have to order two desserts since the menu has a selection of ""dry"" desserts, whereas the sauces and ice-creams are separate desserts on their own. (Ex: if you order their famous apple pie, you'll have to order a portion of their ice-creams separately to get the all-in warm apple pie and ice-cream experience.)**Note if you like chocolate (like me) you'll LOVE their chocolate cake flambe. (pair this together with the honey vanilla ice-cream) DOWNERs: - bread basket was served cold. I'm a sucker for warm, fresh from the oven bread baskets. Tasty bread, but perhaps they like it their way at room temperature. - restaurant layout: as another Yelper had mentioned, this place IS a maze. Upon arriving, my boyfriend and I walked straight into the pastry kitchen and then walked twice around the bar until we found the hostess stand. - the roast chicken entree: other Yelpers had spoken highly of this dish and how tender and succulent the chicken was, and given that I am always super eager to try restaurants' roast chicken dishes, I decided to give this dish a shot. Sadly, I found the dish over-salted and the chicken a little tough. Strange, you would think a place like BDT with all their highly acclaimed ""braising"" would produce a killer roast chicken. - although the waiters here do not sing on birthdays. but they will give you more desserts than you can handle with candles =) and extra boxes knowing you will have to pack everything home. Actually, this is a highlight.I would return to BDT, but not too soon.",Annabel A.

1566,Los Angeles,2010-09-13,2gp1H7CFJ30PQffAQEvdSg,5, CA,"Best place for handcrafted cocktails in DC, IMHO. Pricey but worth it. Drinks are strong, but have the *perfect* balance between liquor and mixer?? (for lack of a better word). And did I mention they are consistent? Been here twice and the drink was exactly the same in flavor, texture, and craft, just the way I like it. The Raspberry Martini is to die for. It might not be on the menu, but they can make it for you. Absolute perfection as far as cocktails go, and coming from me, that says a lot....I've been told I am hard to please on that front, so I guess my standards are pretty high. Apple pie dessert is their specialty, and it's delicious. The pineapple ice cream came at the recommendation of our waitress, and while I necessarily wouldn't put pineapple and apple pie together, it was out of this world!! A must try. The lounge is top notch. Seats are comfortable and relaxing, background noise is not too loud nor intrusive. Urbana at the Palomar in Dupont was my favorite lounge for years. Then people caught on and now its always crowded and trashed and played out. Definitely don't need more of that in DC!

1577,Alexandria,2012-09-22,LvF0rh3QFedDuETCwnKkww,3, VA,"My husband and I had dinner here to celebrate my birthday.  Parking: We arrived a little before 9pm so easily found street parking a little up the block from the the restaurant, but I believe there is valet parking for $10.00.Decor: The restaurant is beautiful as many others have pointed out, from the outdoor landscaping, the oversized doors as you walk into the restaurant, the welcoming upscale decor that brings to mind farm fresh, even the bathrooms that have individual sinks and mirrors within each toilet stall.  We even appreciated the menu printed on good quality paper.  We had a table facing the open kitchen but only spent a few minutes observing since we were mostly eating or talking.  Meal:  The server brought out complimentary bread with butter, some kind of minty cream with a few vegetables on the side.  It was all delicious, the butter and cream were definitely a step up from the normal packaged butters you get at many restaurants.Melon Delight Mocktail $8 - If I recall correctly, this was a combination of watermelon juice, orange juice and ginger ale.  Interesting, but would not order again as I felt the flavors did not blend well together.Bone Marrow Appetizers $15 - Four pieces of bone marrow served with toasted bread, a bulb of roasted garlic on top of a bed of rock salt.  We must be in the minority, but neither of us liked the bone marrow appetizers.  I thought it was lacking in flavor and mostly tasted of salt but I'm probably not a good judge as I don't normally eat bone marrow.  My husband who eats bone marrow all the time thought it just tasted oily and that there was a very small amount of marrow.  After trying the first few bites you could have taken this dish away from us and we would have welcomed you to have it.  I know I was supposed to eat the roasted garlic with the toasted bread but I preferred it on top of the complimentary bread and butter.Suckling Pig $26.00 - 12 Hour roasted suckling pig with baby vegetables and mustard jus.  I thought this combination of pork and sauce and baby vegetables decent but nothing exciting. The pork did fall apart with only a fork, but it was a tad overcooked.  The portion size was just right for me, actually it could have been a little smaller and I would still have been full.  There was a pork rind included as well.   Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes $30.00 - Two crab cakes and reported as very good and filling.Sauteed Wild Mushrooms $12.00 - included olive oil croutons, garlic and parsley.  My husband said this was probably the best dish he had of the night and would not be surprised if the cost of mushrooms were $12.00 and the restaurant had cooked them for free, the mushrooms were that tasty and fresh.Honey Vanilla Ice Cream - comped by the restaurant since it was my birthday (thanks!).   Delicious, not a overly creamy ice cream but a lighter one that went well with the honey flavor.Service: Great service, friendly waiter though a little rushed - the restaurant was busy so the service was not very quick, but I forgave the waiter as he was always with the other tables he had to serve.Overall: I would not return for lunch or dinner because I just don't feel the entrees were really up to par with the reputation or price of the restaurant, but I would probably try the restaurant again for breakfast or brunch.",R Y.

1579,Gaithersburg,2010-07-07,QlRRAXIGQDqy0vyVj_QU9g,4, MD,"I haven't written a review in awhile, but after dining at Blue Duck Tavern last week it has inspired me to write again.My friend and I couldn't decide whether we should go here or not, so we kept making and canceling our reservations, but when we finally got there the hostesses were very accommodating. We had to wait a few minutes at the restaurant's bar, which was nice and comfy. They also gave us free pistachios while we waited.The decor of the restaurant is really nice, but it's still very comfortable and spacious, so you don't feel like you're in some overly pretentious place. The waiter was also very nice and friendly, and I didn't feel like he was undermining us because we were younger and probably won't spend as much.For the appetizer we got the Oven Roasted Bone Marrow and the Roasted Maine Scallops. The bone marrow really blew my mind. Honestly, I didn't really know what to expect, but it was very flavorful and really great to share for two people. I've had better scallops for a lot cheaper, so that dish was kind of a disappointment. For the entree I ordered the Pork Chop and Braised Pork Cheek and my friend ordered the Braised Beef Rib. The pork chop was very tender and really soaked up all the sauces and seasonings that came along with it, but I didn't really like the mustard sauce it was doused in and just kept dipping my pork chop into my friend's braised beef rib's sauce. The braised pork cheek and the braised beef rib tasted pretty identical, minus the sauces that accompanied them. I would choose the braised beef rib over the pork cheek though. We also ordered the Daily Harvest Vegetables, which happened to be zucchini and some type of squash. I didn't really like the squash, but you could tell that all of the vegetables were very fresh.It's an expensive restaurant, but nice for special occasions or if you're getting treated by a special someone! I still want to try their Foie Gras, which was sold out at the time...Blue Duck Tavern I will see you again! Once I save up enough money.",Ashley A.

The sugar cookies were a hit or miss, the entrees were good but not awe inspiring as they were before.  I assume the kitchen must have hired some new interns who needed to get up to speed because things were simply not as perfect as they were before.  Of course, I forgave all transgressions because the staff was so lovely and many of them remembered me by name and, hey, any restaurant can have an off night or weekend.I look forward to returning in the spring when the menu changes, everything tastes better in warm weather anyway.",T B.

Best way to sum their food may be elgant farm to table experience?For those curious readers, yes, I did resist the temptation to lick the bones dry, but only because my overly excited puppies were staring intently at me with their melancholic puppy eyes.",E E.

The pancake comes in a skillet and is enough for two people.  It's very sweet and doesn't really need syrup.  The hash was awesome.  Tender beef, rich sauce, creamy eggs to mix in and one of the best biscuits I've ever had on the side.  The potatoes were also phenomenal.  They also come in a skillet and are crispy on the outside and soft in the middle.  Delicious!  I will definitely be coming back when I decide I can spend $70 for breakfast again.",Peter M.

Although the texture of bone marrow might discourage some people, the rich, unctuous experience of eating it is well worth getting over that hang up.  My main course was a braised beef rib that was perfectly cooked, although the portion size was a bit small.  The pureed potatoes were good, but I was disappointed the highly-recommended BDT fries were unavailable.  The dessert, a blueberry key lime tart, however, made up for the main course.The service was decent: we were greeted and seated promptly, even a bit early for the reservation.  Our server struggled a bit, forgetting our drinks until the main courses were served and not knowing that they were out of fries until he put our order in, leading to a bit of disappointment.  Additionally, while I understand it is a more pricey place, $5 for a soda or iced tea is a little ridiculous.",Addison H.

1602,San Antonio,2009-10-28,OsdO8vmuZSUjewRmHMM_Pw,4, TX,"3.75 stars.  While I have seen a number of reviews at Blue Duck Tavern focus on the bone marrow, the duck confit, the short ribs, and the crabcakes, I haven't seen a great deal of focus on any of the pastas at Chef McBride's restaurant conveniently located within the Hyatt Hotel in the West End neighborhood of DC.   The omission is flagrant given that the Constant Bliss Agnolotti was a breathtaking amalgam of a pleasant seasonal cheese with bitter (artichoke), sweet (fig), and nutty (hazlenut) elements all adding depth to this decadent creation.  While a number of Yelpers suggest the crabcakes (and they are good), I would note that I found myself salivating for a single morsel of the duck confit and braised short ribs tabled adjacent to me.  Having said that, anyone who claims that Old Ebbitt has mastered the art of making crabcakes no longer need to make a trip to Baltimore (almost any restaurant), Annapolis (Cantler's) or Alexandria (Restaurant Eve) to note the errors of their ways.  A short trip to 24th and M will suffice to find a perfectly balanced (albeit miniscule) crab cake. As I have often mentioned (much to the amazement of friends and Yelpers alike), I am not really a dessert person.  Having said that, one would make an egregious error to avoid the undeniably rich in-house Snickers ice cream with chocolate cake.  Overall, Blue Duck Tavern has enticing food served in a slightly stuffy and lightly pretentious space.  Yet despite these trivial concerns, the kitchen cannot be denied.  This is a marvelous spot for dinner after a particularly trying work day.",Yelper N.

They are a great restaurant, great service, very elegant, classy.  They are very modern in their decor, which is not my taste (a little severe) but it definitely helps to create the aura of sophistication.I like that from the main dining room you can see right into the kitchen and watch the food prep; it adds a little theater to the place.At our table, we had:Braised short ribs, a squash agnolotti with puffed parmesan, a green bean and tomato salad with tomato vinaigrette, pureed potatoes with garlic and a chilled corn soup with a cilantro fish emulsion.  The soup was not that great; not overly flavorful and the crab salad in the bottom was not in the description.  (I really don't like mayo, so that was a detraction for me)  However, i had my doubts about the soup before ordering it but was curious because i'd yet to try anything from the realm of micro/molecular gastronomy.  It was interesting and made me curious for other works from the genre, but this soup didn't work for me.The braised short ribs were delicious.  It is not a huge portion, but the meat is perfectly cooked, flavorful, beautifully presented and oh so tasty.  I would recommend this dish.My dining companion had the squash agnolotti and said it was delicious.  It looked amazing and smelled fantastic.  It was a fairly healthy portion and incredibly rich.We shared the sides of beans and potatoes.  I loved the bean salad; very refreshing, very well put together and the tomato vinaigrette was on point.  The potato puree was amazing and very rich.  It is a good choice for sharing, I'd say, because its richness makes it hard to get through without help.For dessert, I had a nectarine and blackberry cobbler and my companion had the blueberry white chocolate key lime pie.  Both were delicious, but both were also bigger than we expected.  Should have shared.  The key lime pie was, again, a rich dish not easy for one to tackle after a full meal.  I would definitely get the nectarine and blackberry cobbler again; the nectarines brought out some great flavor (I've never had nectarines in a pie before, only its safer, fuzzier cousin the peach).The wine list is good, but pretty heavily favors pricy items.  There are enough wines for less than 50 dollars so that you don't have to break the bank, but the majority of the wine list is in the 90+ region.  We had a pinot from oregon (erath vineyard, I think) and it was very good.All in all, a great restaurant with tremendous service.",Scot W.

1611,Washington,2011-02-09,KfOIXB70czYSPoh-tCFLsA,3, DC,"Preface:  I'm an amateur chef and I can cook most of what we find in good restaurants.  I judge a restaurant by whether I can cook better than it can.  On to the review.  We were four and we had four main dishes:Duck breast:  3/5 stars.  Cooked medium rare, but they failed to get the skin crispy.  It's not that hard--you cook it flesh side down on medium, then turn the heat up to high and flip to get the skin crispy.  They had smoked the duck, which was a nice touch.  I can cook it better at home.  Accompanying sauce was quite bland.  Fish (cod and ""angry"" trout) - 2/5.  Boring sauce, skin was one but again not crispy.  If you're going to leave the skin on, make it crispy.  Had bones.  Having just come back from two weeks on the beach in Mexico, I can say I have had much better.  Braised beef (5/5) - Top notch, great presentation, easily the best dish we had.  I can't cook beef this well.  I can easily cook the other dishes at home and make them better.Sides Glazed parsnips with mushrooms (5/5), brussel sprouts (2/5 - no bacon or anything to cut the intensity), polenta with goat cheese (3.5/5 - I thought it was okay but others really liked it), cassoulet (2/5 - couldn't detect any ham or duck confit, just beans).Wine costs about $50/bottle for the ""low end"" selection.  Waiter constantly pouring it into your glasses--I prefer letting the customers enjoy and pour at their own pace.  Always a shame when they pour the last amount into the slowest drinker and then ask if you want another bottle.  Or in this case, my friend said she didn't need anymore for now and he took away her glass for some reason.  I even said, ""It's okay, we can handle pouring it ourselves"" and the waiter said ""No, I'll do it.""  Summary:  Food is a little bland, some dishes are homeruns, others not worth the money, service is on the snotty side.  I may be back in six months or a year to give it another chance--until then, I'll stick to one of the myriad other DC choices.  Cedar in Penn Quarter, btw, is the same price and much better food/ service.",Benjamin L.

I always come back here when I am visiting the city.The decor is beautiful and it is right inside the Park Hyatt Hotel in DC. Everything I have ordered here is absolutely fantastic, but my all-time favorites are: foie gras (appetizer), bone marrow (appetizer), seared scallops (entree) and the braised beef (entree). I suggest getting sides to share since the portions aren't too big and the sides are amazing as well. Price is on the higher end, but definitely worth it!",S L.

Yes, its an expensive meal, but its well worth it. The presentation alone was worth it, but it really was delicious. Would have been 5 stars but the service could have been a touch faster and a touch more attentive (we sat with some empty drinks for a while, that's an easy fix). Will definitely be back. Hint, if you want to sit in the main dining room with the full menu make a reservation REALLY early. Despite being quite expensive this place really is popular.",T A.
1615,Arlington,2013-08-04,ahKEr1jeA-1_1fhyd757Eg,4, VA,"The food here unquestionably lives up to the hype. Went to a birthday dinner for a friend on Friday night and shared the suckling pig, the duck, and the salmon entrees, and added on the roasted baby vegetables, grits, and duck fries. Everything was incredible--my boyfriend, who hates vegetables, is still raving about the roasted vegetable dish, which was heavy on smoky eggplant, perfectly cooked farro, and delicate fennel (which is under-appreciated by contemporary chefs). Of the entrees, the suckling pig is the clear frontrunner, although all are excellent. My only complaint (and the reason for the missing star) was the service. As a former waiter at a well-liked and well-reviewed DC-area French restaurant, I understand that restaurant staff try to project an aloof but friendly and helpful attitude--it's part of the ambiance, and when executed properly can make service feel flawless and professional. Both the host and our waiter went too far, and seemed outright unfriendly to our party from the very beginning. Our waiter pressured us to order more dishes, and seemed annoyed and offended when we made careful selections (we're all in our early twenties and were trying to make balanced selections that wouldn't overburden our underpaid friends). Every rebuffed suggestion, every shared entree seemed like a personal affront to him, and he projected a frankly hostile attitude for the rest of our interactions. After hovering over our table before we ordered, he vanished until one of my friends tracked him down to ask for the check. I understand that it can be difficult to handle (small) groups of young people, but our only crime was a conservative approach to ordering--the subsequent hostility and inattention felt unfair, and cast a real shadow on an otherwise lovely meal.",BT G.

1617,Kansas City,2012-02-02,smLCwU3KDaG3VDAmJkhapQ,5, KS,"Dear Lord, please clear my calendar and fill my wallet so I can eat here three (on the days when I'm being weight and cholesterol conscious) times every single day... Amen... This ""tavern,"" which I would definitely classify as an upscale restaurant - You don't get to share an address with the Park Hyatt unless you clearly measure up - is definitely among the best food I've had in DC. We've been twice, both times for brunch on a Sunday afternoon, and the entire experience was wonderful. The food it top-notch. Literally, everything we have had has been amazing. Not just interesting combinations and new ideas, but beautifully plated and perfectly cooked. The wait staff is highly knowledgeable and more than accommodating. A few favorites and recommendations:1.   The short rib hash will change your life. Definitely order it. And - if you're lucky and remember, ask the server for an extra biscuit. It comes with the hash and is likely to best single food item I've had in the DMV. Flaky, buttery, and salted on top. Absolute bliss...2.   These people know how to clean and prepare an oyster. I recommend a dozen.3.   The Bloody Mary is the best I've ever had. I get mine extra spicy, so if you're in need of a boost after a long night (and not prone to heartburn) order a couple.4.   The mimosas are also excellent. Nothing like French champagne to make anything better.5.   The steak and eggs. Sounds pretty pedestrian for an upscale restaurant, but trust me, there is absolutely nothing about this dish that you've ever tried before. Order it and enjoy. You won't regret it. 6.   The kitchen and bakery are open. You can literally see the entire process from when the order is given to the chef through the prep, firing, and plating. Maybe I'm a huge food geek, but I think it's different and fun.The decor is amazing - the main dining room is open and welcoming without being loud and the bar is separate but connected. The addition of several glass boxes to isolate individual tables breaks up the openness and adds a touch of class to what could have been a pretty average looking space. I haven't been to either the bar or the tea room, but if they're anything like the dining room (which I'm absolutely certain they are) they too will be second to none.",Kati L.

1619,New York,2009-09-23,rwydtlHRfwuZp1hWptOEqw,5, NY,"From the moment I walked through the giant, what seemed like 15 feet, doors of the BDT, I knew I was in for a treat.  I'd been provided many recommendations here and therefore, I knew picking what to eat was going to be a difficult task.  One might say that if the hardest part of your day is deciding between the Vitello Tonnato and the Bone Marrow appetizer,  your day aint that hard!!  One thing to note is that this dinner was a special occasion - my birthday - and so nothing on the menu was off limits, it was acceptable to be extremely decadent with each and every course.  Sorry, I got a little side tracked, back to the entrance.  As you walk in, there are smaller tables to the left and in front of you an open station where it appears a pasty chef was molding and creating the magnificent deserts that would follow the truly delicious meal.  We were escorted past the main dining room past the fully open kitchen to the outdoor patio area.  Our table was next to the large fountain, and quite private.And so it begins.  We were greeted by our waitress, Jamie, who was immediately friendly and telling us BDT first-timers that all dishes are served family style on side plates (actually pots/pans) and that you can mix and match any courses.  Hell, you could get 8 of the delectable side dishes they have.I decided to order a cocktail -  I tried to order a dark and stormy but was informed they did not have the ginger beer required for the drink.   She recommended the mojito and she was not kidding about how good it was.  It was sweet and sour, but nothing like a sour you might normally be accustomed to. My girlfriend ordered a plum cocktail, which came with plum slices and was not as sweet as I thought it might be.For the appetizers, I wavered a bit, but in the end I ordered exactly what I was told to order and what I know I had to try - Bone Marrow.  Let's talk for a moment about bone marrow.  Most places that I have seen or eaten it, it was a small round bone to dip your steak into...not here.  Three large split bones seasoned with paprika and (other spices im sure) a whole bulb, yes bulb, of garlic were served with toast points.  The flavor was stunning, rich, a tad spicy, salty and scrumptious.  I was immediately glad that I decided on this over the other choices.Main course time.  I had initially come here expecting myself to order the duck, after all, its in the name of the restaurant.  However, after some deliberation and assistance from our waitress, I decided to order the ""bbq"" pork.  What they really mean by BBQ is that they use the spices that would go into bbq, but its not bbq by any means -- more of a deconstructed sauce, more french than southern.  Anyway, the pork was three parts, jowls, trotters and terrine.  Honestly, other than the jowls, I don't have a clue what the rest of that stuff was.  But guess what? Who cares!  It was marvelous, succulent, flavorful, juicy, moist, *insert 10 more adjectives here*.  We must not forget the Constant Bliss Agnolloti that my girlfriend ordered, which, talk about decadent, were the most rich, yet tasty 'ravioli' I have ever had.  To go with our already extravagant main dishes, we ordered a side of mushrooms and the BDT Triple fries, fried in duck fat.  McDonalds, Cafe Belga, you name it, eat your heart out!  Best.Fries.Ever.  No contest, no question, don't even bother trying to argue.  You and your fries will lose.  The garlic mayo was a nice compliment, but i preferred the juices from my pork to act as the ""dip.""O.K.  So if the above meal didn't seem like enough food (don't worry, we didn't finish -- there are 3 containers of leftovers), it's time for dessert.  I love pie, apple pie, blueberry pie, peach pie, you name it. Pie.  So what did I get for dessert?  You guessed it, PIE.  Apple Pie.  Not just a little slice.  A freakin whole mini pie.  After eating a bite I knew it was the best pie (except my mom's of course) I had ever tasted.  Crust was soft yet flaky, the top was caramel coated and clearly was fired up with a torch.   My girlfriend got a marscapone chocolate ice cream.  My tiny taste nearly bumped me into a higher tax bracket -- it was that RICH.   The bottom line is that this place is one of the best restaurants in Washington D.C. and one of the best I have eaten, all time.  From the great service, to one dish after another of perfection, there is nothing I can say about this place that isn't some form of high praise.  I highly recommend it.  Oh, and get the bone marrow, just do it.",Evan H.
1620,Washington,2010-06-01,WAxdrby05638RUM9F0oZvQ,3, DC,"I had been wanting to try this place for a while....and I think I could have kept waiting.... But lets start at the beginning ...When we walked in we were immediately greeted by two hostesses who were on the ball. Always a good sign. The first thing you see when you enter the restaurant is their gorgeous pastry kitchen and a very elegant dining room. There are gorgeous tarts, breads and a giant bowl of artichokes and scallions all on display. Very very pretty to look at. Gets the appetite going! The kitchen itself, which is next to the pastry area, feels like its right in the mix of the place and you can really see what is going on. Some people don't like that...but I do. Since it was such a nice night, we sat outside on the patio. Lovely patio, but the chairs are very difficult to move. Kind of annoying...but we are here for dinner and not a furniture fair. We were three people and we each ordered different appetizers so as to get a good selection. My friend M had raw oysters in a carpaccio of raw scallop. The plate featured three of them and a random smear of pureed parsley. I found it to be watery, bland and a not so pleasant slimy/chewy texture in my mouth. I had roasted scallops that were very well cooked, but for the life of me I cannot remember what else was on my plate. A forgettable appy is not good. S had...hmmm...what did he have. A salad I think. So far the service is good, very good actually. Then the main dishes. This is where everything fell apart. I ordered the Muscovy duck with meatballs and a jus sauce. The duck was very undercooked and extremely chewy. The meatballs had flavor, but it was ruined by being too salty. And too salty is hard for me as I love salt. So this dish went back to the kitchen half eaten, and no one asked me why. Another strike. M and S both had the grilled Branzino of the day. I like to filet my own fish so they came whole, tail and head. That's nice...if the fish had not been completely over cooked. It was dry, had little flavor and again, I don't remember what else was on their plates.Finally, desert. This was the best thing we had. A strawberry Rhubarb bread pudding. It was delicious, sweet and tart. But really nothing that incredible. So, if you are interested in a so-so pricey meal, come here. Otherwise check out some very well prepared Confit de Canard at Bistro D'Oc in Penn Quarter.Sorry BDT....but it just wasn't great....:(",Nadine P.

1625,Santa Monica,2010-04-09,_T94MWbUIoG-XK1wU3-fww,5, CA,"Jon-Jenny and I never give a five star review. However, Blue Duck Tavern pretty much breaks the laws of physics of deliciousness and graciousness, so we just had to bust out the nuclear 5-star rating!Setting: very upscale, but casual. It's a place that knows that it is classy but doesn't have to flaunt it. The wait staff was impeccable at every turn. They gladly recommended their own favorite dishes and wines to pair with them. They anticipated our every want. They were professional in the truest sense of the word!Food: We started off with the roasted bone marrow. The taste was earthy and beefy, but so mellow and sublime that Jenny almost fainted. It was served with four giant pieces of bone, sea salt, and the most curiously incredible roasted head of garlic. For dinner, we ordered the Muscovy duck breast with sausage, the braised beef, the polenta with wild mushrooms, and the Brussels sprouts with pistachios. Every dish was incredible. The beef, braised for 36 hours, was so tender that it felt like ice cream. The duck was medium rare and just the mix of meaty, gamey, and salty. The sausage was boldly smoky. The polenta with wild mushrooms was topped with fontina cheese and was silky, hearty, and light at the same time. Finally, the Brussels sprouts were slightly bitter and firm, a good counterpoint to the flavor-packed meat dishes. Dessert: Apple pie. What is so special about the apple pie? We wouldn't have ordered it, except the hostess recommended it. It was so perfectly sweet, tart, flaky, and crispy that it really wipes the slate clean about what an apple pie should be. Drinks: Fabulous. For cocktails, Jenny had the blueberry lemonade and I had a Glenfiddich on the rocks. Both were outstanding and the lemonade was a perfect blueberry distilled into a drink. For dinner, the Syrah went perfectly with the meat. Our waiter was flawless in his recommendation!Conclusion: There is nothing fancy about braised beef or apple pie. Bone marrow and polenta is a little more exotic, but still simple. That is what Blue Duck Tavern excels at. As we Marines say, they demonstrated brilliance- true brilliance- in the basics. Every dish was executed to the highest degree using the freshest ingredients. I cannot write enough praise about Blue Duck Tavern! Jenny- This is definitely the best restaurant experience I've ever had.  From the moment we entered the restaurant until we stepped out, the service was excellent.  The staff really pays attention to detail and they work as a team to give you a grand experience.  I started off with the blueberry lemonade, and it was an excellent fruity cocktail that was not too sweet.  Then we had the bone marrow on bread, and the marrow just melted in my mouth.  It was such a delicate treat!  I usually tend to order seafood, but the farm-fresh meats on the menu were calling my name.  Our server told us that the Muscovy duck breast was the chef's favorite, and indeed it was one of the best I've ever had.  The braised beef was really tender, and I thought the homemade steak sauce as well as the sauce with the duck breast were great matches to the meats.  I enjoyed the brussel sprouts with pistachios, but I couldn't stop eating the polenta with wild mushrooms!  As for dessert, I wasn't sure about ordering something as simple as apple pie, but when the server brought a whole mini-apple pie, I was sold.  It was filled with huge chunks of apple, and not overwhelmingly sweet.  We ordered the pie a la mode, and the homemade vanilla ice cream was delicious.  I've never had vanilla ice cream with such a wonderfully strong vanilla flavor.  The ice cream would have been really good even by itself.  Overall, this is a great restaurant for any occasion.  Birthday or anniversary, with a group of friends, or on a date.  I especially liked how all the dishes are meant to be shared, as each plate comes with serving utensils.  The open kitchen adds a nice touch to the atmosphere, and it's wonderful seeing some of the farm-fresh ingredients around the kitchen.  I could keep going, but I think Jon and I are actually addicted to reading, writing, and thinking about this restaurant right now.  We can't wait to go back!",Jon W.

We felt really weird splitting just one order of duck fat fries between the two of us for such a fancy place, but oh well!It was totally worth it, too. Those fries were amazing. Very thick and flavorful. They come with a garlic aioli which was a perfect complement to the fries. We even considered eating lunch, but honestly, nothing on the menu looked appealing to either of us, so we just did the fries. Everything was really pricey and much fancier than we had anticipated. It wasn't a big deal, though, because we truly only wanted those fries!Mmmmmmm duck fat. I rated it a little low because I think the fries are the only thing I'd ever go back for again.

The venison was tender, juicy, tasty, perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned. As sides we got the fries, the fingerling potatoes with marrow and the brussel sprouts with pistachios. It was all delicious, but particularly the brussel sprouts. The flavor was surprisingly rich.And I must say for what we got, we were pleasantly surprised at what we paid.

We ordered the duck, braised ribs, mashed potatoes and broccoli. Everything was cooked to perfection. In fact, we almost ordered more, but the waiter was quick to let us know that it'd be too much food. The courses are a bit different than other places. The meat dishes are served for one person, while the veggies are meant to be shared. (They call this ""family style.) Wine pairings were excellent. Chardonnay from northern Michigan and a blend from Virginia were poured liberally and saw no complaints at all from this guy.The decor is ideal for the style of food they serve. Solid wood tables, wood floors, and an open kitchen are all complimented by massive ceiling to floor windows.It was pretty much the perfect way to spend a cold Valentine's evening, you know?",Stuart O.

1641,New York,2011-01-06,NsDcLQDiZID5Cal4GROmDQ,5, NY,"Blue Duck Tavern is the real deal.  Even before you step foot inside this masterful DC restaurant, you are both awed and invited in by the 20+ foot tall doors.  Go around the holidays and they hang a beautifl simple wreath on a loooong ribbon.  So great!  So, if you can't tall, I'm a sucker for decor and BDT does not disappoint.  Their simple elegance inside, makes you feel right at home, if that home belongs to Martha Stewart and is impeccably sylish with a feeling of simplicity and elegance at the same time.  They have an open kitchen and open pastry table.  We were seated next to the plating counters, so we had an excellent view of how every dish was prepped and brought out.  Unlike many of the fancier restaurants in town, BDT serves their food family style, which, as a frequent plate-trader, I loved.  Portions are large, even when sharing.  Two entrees and two veggie sides left the two of us very full.  Glad we didn't order any appetizers, because, despite being so stuffed, we obviously ordered dessert!  The peanut butter ice cream was very good for what it was, but I guess I'm just not a peanut butter ice cream kind of gal.  i could tell the quality was there, and my boyfriend sure liked it, but personally, I'd go with one of the crumbles or a plain old vanilla with chocolate sauce.Go and enjoy!!",Lauren Z.
1642,Fairfax,2012-11-12,46pLxqKBbWwyjt7fnYSLZw,4, VA,"I went there a few days ago, and I think it was maybe an off night of theirs.  Maybe it was prime time dinner time so they were stretched thin, but then again, I've always had really high expectations when I come to Blue Duck because they usually always deliver.  Usually, just not tonight.  We went in without reservation on a Tuesday night, and lucky for us we found seats in the lounge.  Except to our surprise they had redid their lounge menu where it didn't have main dishes from their dining room menu, so it was more of an appetizer menu.  However one of the waitresses was extremely nice enough to ask the chef if we could enjoy the full menu in the lounge.  So we were extremely happy even though I really think they should still offer the expanded menu like they use to.So first off, you get served by a number of people while you're in the lounge.  The main waitress brought me tea, but without honey or sugar like usual.  I was a little put off by this because I had to ask for it, and I've never had to ask for it.  Maybe I'm spoiled, but I've been to Blue Duck at least 20 times so you get use to a certain routine.  When I did ask for it, she left and after 10 minutes brought us our appetizer but no honey for the tea.  I thought maybe her hands were full, but nope, she simply forgot.  So I had to ask another waitress as she was passing by for honey, and she managed to get it to me right away.  I think throughout the night, our main waitress was a little lax though.  She didn't bring us any bread, when she did bring us bread, there was no butter.  And she refilled our water after it was done a long time ago.  Overall, it was average service.  But below average if I compare it to all the times I've been to Blue Duck.  The food though was amazing.  We got the Foie Gras with Mushroom as an appetizer, and it was so full of flavor.  We wished there were more of the butter toast to dip it in because it was so tasty.  I had the BBQ Chicken which I have to say is now my favorite BBQ Chicken.  It's not overwhelming but is so refined in it's flavor.  My boyfriend had his sausages and thought it was great.  Now for dessert.  Did they really have to fix up the apple pie?  Why mess with a good thing?  There's less crust because they made the top more crumb-ish.  My filling was actually cold and rather blah.  I don't think I will get the apple pie anymore.  It doesn't bring me back to good old memories, just another disappointing apple pie.        So I'm going to conclude that it was an off night when it comes to service.  But seriously, go back to making the apple pies the way you use to.  This new apple pie was really really disappointing.",Stephanie T.

The food was fresh and delicious. They had a pan seared foie gras for appetizer that had it not been an upscale restaurant, I would've licked the plate :) The wine selection was amazing and our entree (the braised beef rib) was really tender. The dessert, which was an apple pie (that they sold it as ""not your regular apple pie"" and supposedly an amazing dessert) was not as amazing as the rest of the courses... and also considering the price. But it was not bad either. Speaking of prices, it's not a cheap place so keep that in mind. You have to order sides for your entrees, so would highly encourage you to look at the menu first before making a reservation and if price is a concern. I guess that in our experience, the overall quality of the food and wine, the great service, and the ambiance made the visit to this restaurant memorable, hence, the rating.",Yani T.

1648,Washington,2010-07-27,pLwH-vCYn6J76lgQozOiNg,5, DC,"My sister was coming to DC for the first time and I wanted to take her to a good brunch place. I tried Tabard Inn but it was fully booked for Sunday brunch on Wednesday, the same for Founding Farmers, so one of my friends suggested Blue Duck Tavern. I was hesitant because I'm not a fan of hotel restaurants, but I'm really glad we went there.Outdoor seating is available but the indoors was extremely nice and it was so hot out that we decided to take advantage of the AC. We started with a grapefruit juice and a bellini. Both of these were refilled (the juice infinitely!! the bellini twice) throughout the meal. Our server was extremely nice and attentive and the hostesses were really sweet.I had the rock shrimp with scrambled eggs and it didn't pack as much flavor as I expected, but it definitely hits the spot if you're craving a hearty, eggs-and-potatoes breakfast. The shrimp comes in small pieces in the scrambled eggs, but it's a nice combination with the hash brown almost (the best hash brown I've ever had). My sister ordered the waffles with jam and clotted cream and they were really good too. We shared our dishes and had a little bit of sweet and savory. I was disappointed that I hadn't gotten Tabard Inn for brunch but who needs it when you've got Blue Duck Tavern? It's not full, I'm sure lots of people walked in, and the food, service, and atmosphere are great. I definitely want to go again for brunch, lunch or dinner.",Maria C.

We didn't have a reservation and it was of course booked solid so we went to the bar area instead. It was packed but the waitress there was very helpful and eventually found us a small table. That type of service alone already deserved a five-star rating. We had a few cocktails and they were all hit the spot. The pistachios that they kept bringing out (coz I couldn't stop eating) was definitely a plus.  They also have a bar menu which allowed us to try different small dishes. The crab cakes, braised beef and the bone marrow were remarkable. The ambiance was a bit trendy with lots of glass but it was not very noisy.

The staff is also very professional and accommodating - last time I was here half our party was late, and instead of canceling our reservation, the hostess allowed us to check in, have a drink at the bar, and be seated 20 minutes late when the rest of our party arrived.I would go back in a heartbeat.

They also have a great wine program and a very knowledgeable sommelier.  The food is very rustic and rich - think bone marrow, veal meatballs, a lot of braising. We loved the cauliflower soup with lobster, the veal soup, the squash custard (although it is a bit sweet), the roast chicken - all the fish are really excellent, I'd say one standout from the fish would be the cod cassoulet. LEAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!!!!!Seriously, the desserts here are some of the BEST I've had anywhere - especially the chocolate cake and the Lemon Ice Box Cake. They also do great pairings with dessert wines/ports.I am still thinking about the Lemon Ice Box Cake - sooo good. Last time, I got it with the Tomato Jam on the side - I know, sounds TOTALLY bizarre and unappetizing, but it was AMAZING! And totally different from any other dessert.",Elizabeth D.

They have a number of small plates that are great for sharing. I ordered 1 crab cake (one of the best I've ever had), my friend had the sea bass and I ordered a side of farro that was plenty to share between the two of us. The meal was light, refreshing and just hit the spot. To finish, we shared the lemon ice box cake, which is a beautiful and inventive dessert with a flat lemon custard, infused gels, blueberry meringue and pearls. SO good! Then they brought us 6 little sugar cookies in a bag with our check, which she took to work the next day and shared with our team.",Madeline S.

The appetizer portion of the crab and avocado salad is a bit small to share but the eggplant flatbread was delicious and enough for three to share nicely.

For more specific deets: I'd give the scallop carpacchio a pass. They overdo the lime aspect, which I suspect might be because of the quality of the scallops. The cheese plate was delish and had all kinds of awesome accoutrements that really enhanced the flavors of the cheeses. Their martinis were fabulous (so I had three). I didn't review the wine list, but our waitress was helpful in choosing one.Overall, I'm giving this place four stars for ambience, service, and liquor.

I started with the bone marrow, which as the pictures show is huge and just tremendous.  It is topped with spices that perfectly accent the flavor.  Getting this bone marrow is like a child's christmas morning.  To the chagrin of my dining companions, I am used to scraping out bone marrow with the smallest ,sharpest object I can find. I hope for a square centimeter of bone marrow but usually get less with bone shards mixed in. At my Blue Duck dinner, I was presented with a whole femur clean-cut lengthwise and a spoon - on a silver platter.  Merveilleux.  For dinner, I had the short ribs. Perfectly juicy, tender and flavorful. Did not use my knife to cut it. The meat strands nearly separated themselves with the slightest pressure of my fork. It was just delicately seasoned to slightly complement the flavor of the meat, but it let the meat speak for itself.  It was incredible.  Our waitress wore a suit and was perfectly pleasant and had perfect timing.  I have also come for brunch and you cannot come here for brunch without getting the triple fries.",Keri M.

Succotash- very good.  Fresh corn, lima beans, it was a lovely side order.Fries-  Umm, they were good but nothing to rave about.Blackberry/nectarine crumble- loved the crumble part especially the walnuts.  The fruit were too sweet, they can really cut the sugar and let the fruit sell the dish.  I think nectarines are still in season.",Chocolate Q.

1671,Greenbrae,2010-02-03,TdoN1I-lTNnn2bNMwU3bQw,4, CA,"If you are celebrating a milestone, Blue Duck is certainly special - for that it gets 4 stars. I have been here 3 times now, and yes, it's delicious!!! But, I think it's slightly over-priced for the entrees/sides my family and I have enjoyed there (their steak, french fries, mashed potatoes, green beans, amazing chicken soup, roasted chicken, fried chicken, crab cakes, marrow). For these types of meals, I'm more inclined to give it a slightly lesser 3-3.5 star rating. I was spoiled living in the San Francisco area 20 years where excellent, fresh, innovative foods, and comfort-food is offered at all price-points. I could easily eat this well in SF for half the price, but maybe it's not fair to make this sort of comparison... in the Bay Area this would be just another fancy, but very good place to eat, even with the bone-marrow entree. (BTW, personally - yuk!) The restaurant itself is elegant, impressive, and beautiful - I LOVE the open kitchen, and the bar atmospheres equally. I liked eating in the glass booth, where my naughty 3 y/o didn't have to disturb others. I love to make it a regular restaurant, but it's just not in my budget to visit frequently.  I have to say that if you must choose between Blue Duck tavern and a similar ""foodie"" place - Obelisk, for example, Blue Duck is WAAAAAY better IMHO!

So you can imagine my delight when I traveled to DC last week for work and, after checking into the Park Hyatt, the adorable Italian man, Paulo, who escorted me to my hotel room (a concept I still can't get over) told me that Blue Duck Tavern was located in this very hotel! Needless to say, my dinner plans were cut out for me and so I finally got a taste of BDT and the pure awesomeness it embodies. For starters, they have Oven Roasted Bone Marrow with Spiced Pumpkin Butter -- I have eaten bone marrow growing up and absolutely love it, but I have never seen bone marrow of this quantity and quality... it sits on a bed of rock salt, so it's slightly salty, but so scrumptious. The Wood Oven Fired BDT steak was perfectly cooked and the Carmel Road Pinot Noir complemented it wonderfully. The side of Braised Escarole with Sharp Provolone and Fig Vincotto was so fresh and uniquely flavored. My only critique would be that the apple pie be served with vanilla ice cream (fat kid over here). Overall, an extremely rich yet satisfying meal that allowed me to drift into a peaceful sleep that evening. My compliments to Executive Chef Brian McBride and Chef de Cuisine John Melfi.",Pia S.

On to the amazing main course: The beef ribs are the best I have ever had.  They are tender, juicy, slight fatty (in a good way, trust me ) and seasoned perfectly.  There is a great sauce in the bottom that is a pan sauce of sorts, it's better than butter.The brussel sprouts are amazing, just tender enough, and seasoned perfectly.  The star of the meal was certainly the bone marrow potatoes.  I know what you are thinking, ""bone marrow, that is gross"", well trust me, it is the best flavor on earth.  The potatoes crispy, tender and marrow adds a great beefy and sweet flavor.  Hands down, go to this place, it is worth every penny.  Oh, the service is great, they are very unobtrusive; I didn't get a sob story about how they are working through college, we all did it.",Joe C.

I suggest getting the scallop appetizer, braised ribs entree (which was very tender), and mango ice cream! Great food and service at reasonable prices!  The only thing is the awkward layout of the restaurant.  I felt like it was divided so that it seemed a lot smaller than it was.  I will definitely be coming back soon.",Lisa N.
1677,Chicago,2011-05-27,nmnuRhgQ-zcoC2wEYeGBYA,4, IL,"i gave the straight-from-the-oven chocolate cake my heart, and it singed the top layer of my thumb's skin right off. love hurts.aside from that, our visit to the infamous bdt was quite enjoyable. the bone marrow was pretty indulgent. and by that i mean i limited myself to one, spreading it over a piece of bread and sprinkling it lightly with some sea salt from the bed it sat atop. my mother would go on to complain for the rest of the night about how she ""shouldn't have"" and she could ""feel it sliding down her throat"". first of all, that's what she said, mom. second of all, the table knew she secretly loved it.we also started with the crispy pork terrine which was even more of an appetite whetter. served with a ""sunny up egg"" and an elixir vinegar, it teased my tastebuds.for my main course, i had the venison cooked medium rare. it came out just how i wanted it, with a little extra juice, and a turbo shallot on the side. i'd like to point out that before i decided on this dish, i asked our server about it and he gave a full-blown three-minute speech on venison meat and how it differs from your everyday cow. overwhelmed and impressed, i agreed to try it, and was so happy i did.the other main courses at our table were the muscovy duck breast with a duck leg ragout and huckleberries and the braised beef rib with homemade steak sauce, both of which were also exceptional (though i'm still biased towards the venison). the beef rib was on the bone but impossibly tender. you touched it with a fork and it fell right off. the duck wasn't gamey at all, and i particularly enjoyed the crispy end bits bursting with flavor.for sides, we got the warm pie of swiss chard and sweet potato and, of course, the hand-cut bdt triple fries. the pie wasn't exactly a slice of heaven, but that didn't matter because the fries more than made up for any part of the meal that was less than perfect. i can't even type thinking about those little treasures. just.....please get them.finally, for dessert, we got the apple pie, carrot bread pudding with run raisins and cream cheese mousse, and what i now refer to as the ""love hurts"" chocolate cake, which is definitely ""straight from the oven"" as the menu boasts, and ignited through a maker's mark flambé. the apple pie's crust was my ideal crust:: slightly on the softer side and dusted with tons of cinnamon. i could've just eaten the crust itself and would've been content. the filling was good too, though! the bread pudding was unique and those little raisins sure carried a lot of rum! the light woozy effect of the raisins caused little fairies filled with mirth in my head to traipse about. and really, no more words are necessary for the chocolate cake, so just grab a fork and take a bite.",Amanda S.

I was impressed with the experience from beginning to end. ambience was modern and sophisticated but relaxing and every dish we ordered was delicious. this is definitely a place where you indulge. pricing is definitely fair and not overly expensive considering you leave full.we ordered the following:- oven roasted bone marrow w/country bread (id pass on this. i would have preferred that the portion was smaller being that its quite rich)-roasted maine scallops (cant go wrong. scallops were big and juicy)-roasted tavern steak - (cooked perfectly on an iron skillet)-jumbo lump crab cakes (be in the mood for crab. lots of crab meat w/not  much filler)-young yorkshire pork terrine (a little dry but good flavor)-cheddar heirloom grits (had a nice spicy kick but was very rich)-baked rice w/homemade andouille (andouille was good but have had better sausage rice dishes)-kohlrabi gratin (highly recommend)-warm swiss chard, raisin, pinenut pie (must be a fan of raisins)coming from LA i feel that a lot of the food in DC is a bit more heavy/hearty. this is a place to come for a special occasion.",Puna K.
1679,McLean,2010-08-17,qT_3HGDI7RcKI-M7A7o4Dg,4, VA,"Still hit or miss.  But the hits are really great and the misses are still pretty good.  Also the service is just impeccable.  The second time I came here was for restaurant week.  I was very impressed that they did not hold back on the restaurant week menu, they included some really great options, and in addition to your three courses everyone got to choose a side, which means you get *a lot* of food here for only $20.I was disappointed with the duck confit.  It was duck confit, but there wasn't anything special about it.  Everyone raved about the bone marrow appetizer, but I was just a tad too squeamish to try it, but you probably should if you go.  I really enjoyed my dessert, a nectarine & blackberry crumble.  Great flavors and great texture of the crumble on top.  Oh i also had the summer succotash side, it was really good, very fresh and a good accompaniment to any of the mains.  The mushrooms in it were definitely a miss though.  They tasted like nothing and had a gummy texture that did not go well with the corn.Other people's dishes: the vegetarian warm zucchini pie was quite good.  I'm always skeptical of the vegetarian entree, especially at restaurant week, but I should have known that at Blue Duck Tavern they would respect vegetarians.  For an example of that, my friend ordered the Escolar in Minestrone broth, and when she asked if the broth was made with meat the waiter immediately asked if she was a pescetarian and said it would be fine.They delivered all the mains and all the sides at the same time, which was really something to behold.  The staff are attentive, very professional, adept at answering questions about the food and making recommendations.  Definitely feels like fine dining.  Also the restaurant is just beautiful.  You are immediately excited to be there.  The open kitchen is really fun and feels special.All in all, very impressive experience.  I sort of feel like I keep ordering wrong, but after two tries I don't think its my fault anymore.",Charlotte S.

1682,Washington,2009-07-06,JhbyonQRSPrDv6ujjgwfAQ,3, DC,"3.5 stars I enjoyed having dinner at the Blue Duck Tavern but I can't really say I'd hurry to come back. The open kitchen was neat and different and we lucked out with a table close by so we could watch the chefs at work. However, the rest of the set up felt scattered, with tables here and there. Initially, it took us a bit just to find someone to seat us because the large wooden doors were bolted shut.  We found ourselves entering through the hotel and wandering through the restaurant in search of the hostess. The cocktails were delicious, we tried the cherry blossom and the kiwi spritzer.  A bit pricey though at $15 each. We split the soft shell crab which was a bad beginning to the meal. I think the way to best describe it was ""soggy"" and it was entirely dependent on the remoulade sauce. I had just had a great soft shell crab the weekend before so the fresh comparison in my mind made this one seem even worse. I had the Roasted Tavern Steak which was cooked very nicely and had lots of flavor. I also liked the cherry mustard marmalade it came with. My boyfriend had the Braised Beef Rib which was very good as well. We split the BDT Triple fries and I thought they were about average. A few were slightly undercooked. For dessert we split the apple pie and, despite our waiter cautioning us that it was cooked for an individual, it was more than enough for two people. I asked if it was possible to have a scoop of vanilla ice cream with the pie and our waiter said yes, and then proceeded to give us the full five scoops at regular menu price. I didn't think it would be a problem to have just one scoop on an apple pie but apparently it's all or nothing. It would have been nice if the waiter had mentioned this. By this time we were pretty full so a good portion of the five scoops just sat and melted.Overall, the entrees were very good but if I came back I'd try different appetizers and sides.",M T.
1683,Burbank,2010-06-22,gky9OLwhsMJjWj8Ly4yEaQ,5, CA,"So on my first night in DC I went to Blue Duck. I can tell you enough from the beginning till end this place lives up to it. To begin, we didn't have a reservation so there was a wait of course. Only 20min which ended u being 35min, however my buddy and I didn't mind at all. Reason for that is they have a great bar/lounge in the front which kick off our night. The bar is great a little small but More of a lounger spot. The drinks were great!! a must if you have time. The bar tender was really awesome and vibe was great. Next was the dinner. All we order was great from the rib's to the duck breast. This food is made with feeling and passion. Great service and great food. It maybe a little pricey however nothing to be disappointed about. Overall very good place to eat.",Bibb B.
1684,Boston,2012-06-16,EHbGQuNc_TH-SQeho15kMw,4, MA,"Update after another visit- still just as wonderful! The seasonal soup is always a great choice; even chicken is amazingly tender, flavorful, with just the right amount of thyme and heavenly crunchy skin. A star off for some small mishaps with the staff though...for example, the ice cream bowl had bits of black dust in it, and I feel that it is the restaurant staff's job to make sure that the diner gets clean utensils. Another example was when I asked how a dessert item was presented, the server responded with, ""Oh, it's lovely."" I had to probe about the dessert composition. BDT is still my favorite in DC.",Jungmin L.
1685,Washington,2009-05-11,6cAwXz7ErTUOQKvOHBH2CA,4, DC,"After a far too long hiatus (ahh finals), back to reviewing!FOOD: 4.5DECOR: 5SERVICE: 3.5I've heard rave reviews for so long that I really couldn't wait to come here.  What better post-exam celebratory spot than ""one of the best restaurants in DC"".  I must say I was impressed.First, the decor, from the huge doors to the minimalist grandeur to the expansive (not expensive) windows, reminded me of a less impressive (though still amazing) Per Se.  My favorite decor of any restaurant in DC, without doubt.  If only the view was of Columbus Circle instead of 23rd and M... Oh well. You do the best you can with what you've got.  It's also quite cute that you can watch them making all the apple pies right in front of you when you walk in (more on the phenomenal apple pies later).Second, and the least remarkable, was the service. Good, but not amazing. Our waiter was very nice, but I had to search him out several times. Also, I would've like more detailed advice regarding the menu and wine list.  No major snafus though, and the staff seemed quite well trained overall.Finally, the food. Excellent, very excellent. I love that they source all their ingredients, which lends credence to their commitment to knowing what you're eating.  There's definitely something to knowing the city from which the mushrooms you're munching on were foraged, or the farm at which the cow you're eating was raised.  On to the specific items:Bone Marrow: in my opinion, the best item I had. Served still in bone, and delicious. The rich fattiness of the marrow is wonderfully complemented by the paprika, sea salt and fresh pepper.Heirloom Grits: I was excited about the prospect of homemade grits with cheddar, but this was probably the most disappointing element of the meal. BDT Triple Fries: I mean, they're solid (and huge) french fries. Nothing to write home about in my opinion, unless you're a fry fanatic, which I most definitely am not.Roasted Mixed Mushrooms: awesome. I love mushrooms, and there were a number of various North American types in the dish, all of which were awesome. Perfectly cooked, the moderate roasting set off their flavors well while not blasting them to rubberiness.Kohlrabi Gratin: my second favorite side dish, after the mushrooms. Lathering almost anything in cheese (I believe it was blue or gorganzola, though I can't recall anything except the richness) will make me happy, but when I tasted the smooth richness of the cheese set off by the crunchy earthiness of the kohlrabi, I found the combination to present a well balanced dish, excellently conceived and prepared.The Spinach and Carrots were both fresh and well prepared, but nothing special.The Tavern Steak: very juicy, and well cooked to a healthy medium rare. A good cut of meat, and one that I preferred to the braised beef.The Braised Beef: definitely melt-in-your-mouth tender. I have to give them that, but otherwise I wasn't impressed with this dish.  The flavor was sort of bland.The Chicken: solid, but it's chicken. It was very juicy chicken though.The Pork Porterhouse: my favorite main dish. The porterhouse came in two different cuts, one thinly sliced and another cubed.  The moistness and rich flavor of the porterhouse made this my favorite despite the fact that I usually find pork difficult to do well. The braised endive was a simple but good complement to the meat.Apple Pie: simply fantastic. The best apple pie I've had in the US for sure, and better than most I've had in Europe.  A crispy, sweet crust, rich and fresh apples and none of the preserved taste of the vast majority of even freshly made apple pies. If at all possible, keep room for this desert!Fruit and Cream: a very refreshing and light dessert for those that want an comprehensive meal, but are far too full for anything else.An amazing meal. I will certainly be back.",Mark A.

1689,Washington,2012-10-30,BHrEV2gEqAPAtZgSRxMgxQ,4, DC,"Went here last minute for a friend's birthday, and because we were the crazies that ventured out into the hurricane there were no lines and no reservations needed.  The atmosphere was swanky yet rustic at the same time, we started out in the lounge in what I only describe as a glass cubicle which was an awesome setup for a little privacy.What we ordered:- Dark and stormy: weather appropriate. Boy was it strong! But awesomely gingery, something that I think is lacking from a lot of stormies that I've had (I do love my ginger).- Hand cut BDT triple fries: perfection. Crispy outside, mushy inside, great flavor, and I couldn't get enough of that aioli sauce (literally, that container was cleaned UP before I let the server take it away)- Roasted pork: our favorite. super super tender, probably because they roasted it for 12 odd hours or so. the sweetness in the sauce complimented the pork beautifully. - Braised Beef Rib: fell apart so beautifully, melt in your mouth goodness. great sauce. probs my #2 favorite of what we ordered.- Duck: disappointing! especially for a place with duck in their name. the meat and the fat were a little chewier than I would have liked, and the pumpkin didn't add much to the dish. decent, probably wouldn't get it again though especially for the price tag.- Market Fish of the Day: this was dorade, skin was crispy and well seasoned but the rest of the fish was a little blah.- Brussel sprouts: came with walnuts and cranberries, decent but a little too bitter for my liking.Portion sizes are not big for what you're paying, but everything was so rich that I didn't mind that much. The service was awesome. We were checked on frequently, but not enough to be obnoxious. When we told the server it was our friend's birthday he served us a complimentary apple pie (must get, if only for the crispy sugary crust on top).All together it was a great experience, great staff, I'd go back again but probably to try their brunch.",Elaine C.

Fun! All the kitchen staff looked in sync and it was neat to watch food being prepared. Like Hell's Kitchen, only without the profanity and raw food. The food selection was bigger than I expected this kind of fancy restaurant to have. Everything was listed with concerns to where the food came from and thanks given to the food providers. They have suitable options for vegetarians, but not vegans. (Oh, the marscapone ravioli!) The drinks were varied, flavored. Had a delicious flight of honey brandys that made me wish I wrote what they were down. My meal was a tad on the rich side - again, oh the marscapone ravioli! It had interesting mix of cheese, sweet, date and mystery herb. The portion size was appropriate filling for the dish, I was not left wanting. The sides are huge. The toasted mushrooms had just the right amount of garlic hints, though big floppy mushrooms skeeve me out a little. I was assured by the other diners that they were delicious.

We went at an off time on a Wednesday evening and because the restaurant hadn't opened yet, it was raining, and we were starving, we opted to sit in the lounge-- which serves food from Blue Duck Tavern's kitchen in the form of a limited menu. We ordered two cheeses: a sassafrass leaf-wrapped goat cheese and a lavender/espresso rind cheddar, and both were fantastic. I loved the wine recommendations from our server/bartender to accompany my meal, and the Sauvignon Blanc I was drinking went perfectly with the cheeses and the other two dishes we tried: the lobster roll and the risotto. The risotto was a beautiful green color, with fresh peas and greens in it, and was perfectly cooked. The lobster roll was just fantastic. I am from the south and had not had a proper lobster roll before, but the friend who was with me said that it was close to authentic and done nicely. I loved the atmosphere of this place, its layout, its decor, the service, and most of all, the food. I would give the Blue Duck 5 stars, but I didn't get to sample as much of their food as I'd hoped to. I would absolutely come back here on my next visit to DC!",J W.

It's tart and taste like pickle juice ... and next $10 for a side vegetable dish of brussel sprouts and sour apple... the brussel sprouts were bitter and half charcoaled...  come on, everyone who knows the basic cooking techniques knows, brussel sprouts should be poached lightly to remove the bitter taste... OK, last but not the least...  the lamb shank ... it looks like it came freshly out of Costco package, half heartedly nuked in the microwave and dished out to a serving plate for $34... and need I mention, the service... one server kept dropping plates, silverware on the floor... maybe it was just that night... but it's definitely not pleasant when customers coming for a fine dining experience, but end up hearing this every 10 minutes...  I think I'll not return nor recommand this place to my friends...",J W.

I'd be engrossed in conversation, turn back to reach for my drink and find that it had already been re-filled.  I rarely had to ask for anything without it being anticipated or proactively asked by the staff. Atmosphere--5 Stars.  The lounge is a work of art with a modern flair of steel and glass, yet remained warm and inviting with it's quirky wood chairs and red bricked pastry kitchen. Food--4.5 Stars.  The roasted Maine Scallops were hands down in top 5 of all time scallops I've had especially considering the generous portions at $15.  The braised beef rib was good, but I'll not great to the point where I'm rushing back anytime soon to order it, whereas I probably would for the lump crab cakes.  Finally, we ended dinner with the Warm Flourless Chocolate Cake Flamed with Bourbon and the Hazelnut Amaretto Cheesecake.  Both desserts were executed well, but I'd give the nod to the cheese cake (and of course the apple pies looked gorgeous, but I opted out since I'm not much of an apple person unless we're talking about computers instead of food).",Peter C.

I did try the vaunted bone marrow appetizer, and here's what I have to report: it tastes exactly like bacon, eggs and toast, from the texture to the flavor. So if you like $15 bacon and egg appetizers, go for it!The food does tend to be on the heavy/decadent portion of the spectrum at BDT. One appetizer, one a la carte entree and one side per person was too much for for two people, so order with restraint.-1* The wine is outrageously priced. One example: on the cabernet sauvignon list, two of around twenty five wines were priced under $100 bottle(!).-1* Value. It shouldn't cost $190 (including tip) for two people to have an appetizer and an entree with a side, and a bottle of wine (a surprisingly bargain priced Director's Cut Zinfandel) . Even by DCs already inflated prices, that's a bit much for what you get.Nice atmosphere and solid food. I may be back, but probably only for the apple pie that I was too full to order.",RJ S.

We went late and it was a beautiful night out, the Yankees were staying in the place (we found out later) and we sat front row to the kitchen. The sear foie was outstanding, only bettered by the fresh oysters (more please). Suckling pig was a nice treat from the menu and the cobia was flavorful and cooked just right so that it fell apart in its pretty stainless steel vessel. Apple pie for dessert, almost as good to watch it being made than to eat it, with the excellent coffee, nice way to end.negatives: all the things that we didn't order didn't come to our table (bone marrow next). also, could not eyeball where they kept the oysters in the kitchen which made it difficult plan my smash and grab job. next time.",Philip L.

They really know what they are doing, no matter what function they have. Coats are hanged by the name, no number or card need. The open kitchen, just there at the front, makes the second statement of professionalism and care. We made the reservations using Yelp webpage and we were sat on time, by the window. Our maître came and saluted us in a very kind way and he was so knowledgeable and confident, yet leaving you space to decide by our service. I follow his advice and had a great dinner experience.

Blue Duck has both, as well as exceptional service and an incredible menu that is sure to please any functioning palette.I first came here for dinner and brunch right when BDT opened a few years ago, but returned last week and was reminded as to why it's so popular. The pea soup with ravioli was delicious, but the best appetizer by far was the warm asparagus topped with a magical poached egg. The braised beef rib was so tender, I wanted to take it home and spoon it but there wasn't any left. The grilled whole fish of the day was a tilefish- a white, mild fish that was simply grilled and perfectly unfussy. My favorite sides are the baked rice with andouille and the sauteed spinach, but the fries were a big hit as well. The banana chocolate chip sorbet was divine (one serving = enough for a table of four) and the cherry rhubarb pie a perfect sweet ending to an all-star meal. BDT is definitely the crown jewel in the West End's restaurant crown.",Chelsea M.

The best things about this restaurant are precisely the things that you should look for when you go out: the quality of the food and the service. The food is terrific -- tasty and filling, without ever leaving you feeling like you've gorged yourself on a bucket of KFC chicken skins. Prices are extremely reasonable and are a steal for the quality and size of the portions. The service is even more astounding.

Talk about good marketing for hungry diners!  I should note, we sat outside, and the restaurant did a great job of making you feel like you were separated from busy M street, to which the patio is adjacent.The food was fabulous.  We got apps, and we tried a sampling of the seasonal sides (my fave being the heirloom grits).  I also had their braised spare rib, which was phenomenal!I also have to say that the service was GREAT.  One of my biggest sticking points with restaurants (particularly the higher-end restaurants) is the quality of their staff and service.  Servers were very knowledgeable about the menu and wine list.  They were also appropriately attentive, with out being pushy or intrusive.  Kudos, kudos!",Kristen W.

1728,Washington,2011-12-31,wR48ux5In_lzZy3orAjNDg,4, DC,"Last night's dinner at Blue Duck Tavern was disappointing after coming here a few times. It's hard to imagine that the restaurant could disappoint but last night was definitely not up to par. This is also one of the few times I'll be forgiving and say that you should not use last night's experience as the review to gauge this restaurant. My friend and I started off with the famous duck fat fries. The fries came out way over fried. This had never happen before! *cue dramatic Italian opera* Even in the dark lighting I could tell it was overdone. I was a little shocked that it was even allowed to be served. After taking a fry, we sent it back. The next set of fries came back overfried as well. I know BDT is usually anal about the food so it was even more shocking to see a new set of fries coming from an obviously same batch of over cooked fries.  To be fair, the server took it off the bill but it didn't fix the foodie problem. Because the fries were overcooked, the steak cut fries had a very tough exterior, not the usually fluffy and delicate taste that accompanies my burning tongue. It also lost the flavor of the duck fat so it was not a good start to the meal. We eventually polished off the fries but it took much longer than usual because we had to use the knife and fork to saw apart the fries. *note to newbies* You should strongly consider ordering the duck fat fries, oven roasted bone marrow, and braised goat. Verified as usually delicious food. The server came back to take the entree orders and we ordered the braised beef rib and the braised bison shank. The server missed the beef rib order in the first shot so we did not have the usual swarm of people serving us which is one of my favorite things at this restaurant. After missing the beef rib order, the server did manage to bring out the second entree in 2 minutes so it was a good save.The braised bison shank comes all the way from Durham Ranch, WY. I could almost taste Dick Cheney's shotgun residue. JK JK. Bison is a leaner red with less fat and comparable amounts of protein vs. beef. The shank was covered in a stout sauce with some cocoa nibs.  To the side of the shank was a nice thick puree of parsley root that almost reminds you of a slightly more liquified mashed potatoes. When stirred with the sauce, it brings out the rich dense flavor of the bison meat. It tasted good but it may have been cooked a little bit longer than it should have. The bison was drier than the last time we ordered it. The masterpiece of the evening was braised beef rib from KS. It's almost unfair to compare bison to the beef rib because the beef rib will take your breath away. We were presented with three cubs of beef on top of a large bone with a nice steak sauce. I strongly suggest that you do not rush through the dish but do as I say not as I do because my friend and I polished this dish off in minutes. The meat on the beef rib was amazing! The tender beef covered with a thin layer of fat. It doesn't melt in your mouth but you almost want to take the time to taste the sauce used to braise the very fatty beef rib.We also ordered the daily harvest vegetable of the day- mushrooms. This dish never fails, it was a plate of 2-3 types of mushrooms from PA. It was sauteed well with a touch of salt and complimented with some crunchy croutons.You should never forgo the dessert here but we had to last night in order meet some friends at another restaurant. You should strongly consider the honey vanilla ice cream. It's home made ice cream that will make your stomach burst with happiness. Service is usually amazing but last night was definitely an off night. First missing one of the entree orders and then over all lack of attentiveness was a slight turn off. Overall the food is amazing and the decor matches the food. It is a very special restaurant in my heart.",Stephanie C.

1735,Washington,2008-11-24,ozwKtCicN0RoZ5qSRaoHWA,4, DC,"Stef and I took advantage of Blue Duck's Saturday brunch in order to try the restaurant without shelling out for dinner.  We really are clever that way :-)The kitchen and dining area are all open to each other, and so amazingly clean and minimalist that it is nearly (just nearly) creepily sanitized.  There were only a few tables filled, so we received plenty of attention from the servers. In fact, at times, the attention was intrusive.  But everyone was so deferential and eager to please that it was easy to forgive them.  I started with coffee (mmm, smelled so fresh), and sliced bread (mmmm, also very fresh).  We ordered our entrees and decided to split a side dish of mac and cheese.  This turned out to be a good decision -- the entrees were of good size, but not ridiculously large, and hence we were able to eat the side dish as well.My Eggs Benedict were cooked perfectly, and served perfectly.  Stef's goat cheese and leek quiche tasted exquisite.  The mac and cheese spaetzle with duck confit was amazingly rich.  We enjoyed all of the flavors.We lingered over our food, and chatted for quite a while, but in no way were made to feel rushed.  I have to believe that not many people know that they serve a Saturday brunch, otherwise it would be much busier, and we wouldn't have had the pleasure of relaxing there for so long.One thing is for certain -- I feel confident that I will in fact come back for a special occasion dinner sometime soon, and that I will be happy with the experience.  Blue Duck has charmed me with its food and attentive service.",Mary Kay S.

Moser modern shaker furniture - adding to the mix of high and low design.Our dinner was the whole roasted fish of the day (good but only mostly deboned), jumbo lump crabcakes (fantastic with almost all jumbo lump crab), grits with cheddar (awesome), and carrots (nothing standout).On my way to the restroom I walked by the kitchen and saw a dessert that looked great, but I wasn't sure what it was.  After talking to our server about it, he invited me back into the open kitchen to point out which one I wanted.  It's this kind of informality that I find refreshing in a restaurant.  The dessert that I wanted turned out to be the apple pie, which with vanilla ice cream was really great.  We took a bit of the pie home with us and received a package of delicious chocolate, pecan and cranberry cookies as well.",Jeff P.

I have three words to describe the food: de-li-cious!  Dinner was an amazing, taste-exploding meal that can easily qualify as one of the best meals I've honestly ever had in DC.  The generous mustard spaetzle ""mac and cheese"" duck confit was rich and delicious and the huge braised lamb shank was fall-off-the-bone succulent and tender. The juices from the shank was so good I was half-tempted to lick them off the serving dish, had I not remembered my surroundings.  I scarcely had room for dessert, but I dug down deep and managed to find the space in my distended stomach.  I read quite a bit about their apple pie from other Yelpers but I decided to go differently with the bittersweet chocolate cake flambéed in a dessert liquour.  It was sinfully good and I was now sinfully lethargic.  The price of the entire meal was very reasonable, given the food quality and preparation and the level of service we received.  This was a stellar dining experience and I have absolutely no gripes to give at all.  The only thing I would do differently the next time is to request to be seated near the gorgeous open kitchen and watch, in complete fixation, the chefs work their magic!!",Jim D.

1740,Washington,2008-10-27,5ffsOKuJMYFRIpw2n_wwqw,5, DC,"I think there appears to be 2 traditional styles of writing your 100th review. The first is to write about something quirky, funny or random, such as an Exxon station or your own ass, and the second is to do something really memorable and satisfying. I have decided to go with the latter, and the Blue Duck Tavern for my 28th birthday dinner is the lucky recipient. It's all the more memorable because I got to dine once again with my favorite companion, Nicole, who makes every meal more special for me, but the really great ones I would hate to eat without her. Last night she looked like 6 stars, and it's a gift in itself to be the guy in the restaurant with the girl that everyone else looks at. I am a damn lucky man, and not soon to forget it.I don't typically ask for a lot on my birthday, if anything at all, but the one thing I do want is to have a really great meal along with fantastic wine. Luckily my cellar at home means the second part usually only costs me a corking fee, which happens to be the standard $25 here, and the choice for the night was Andre Brunel's ""Les Cailloux"" Chateauneuf du Pape ""Centenaire"" from 2001. It could have easily sat another 10 years before opening, but I couldn't resist last night, and I was so glad I chose it once I saw the menu. I scoured for quite a while trying to find the perfect spot to eat, something near the edge of the culinary scene, but still traditional enough to be somewhat familiar. The chefs at Blue Duck delivered the meal part spot on, and while it wasn't the best I've had in DC, it was nearly flawless in its delivery.The family style servings here are not what I consider your normal restaurant family style, so don't expect a huge bowl of anything that you can split between the entire table. They are however a genius idea if there is just a pair of you, because it makes sharing these wonderful creations so much easier. Even the meat is pre-sliced for you, so you can just use the tongs and serve some to your partner. We tried to photograph as much as possible, so you can hopefully tell exactly what kind of portion sizes to expect.Up first were the two appetizers we ordered, the pumpkin custard with huckleberries, rosemary and pumpkin seed praline & the mustard spaetzle ""mac and cheese"" with duck confit. They were both rock solid, outstanding dishes. The pumpkin custard had a really nice bitter tartness to it, and the praline on top gave it almost a creme brulee type texture. The spaetzle with duck confit was heavenly. I could have just ordered 2 of these for dinner and been very content. They do not skimp on the amount of duck in this dish at all, and the bread crumbs retain a good bit of moisture so it's really tender to eat, very much like a really expensive and delicious casserole. I want the recipe!For dinner we decided to go with the smoked duck breast with confit of leg & the braised beef rib. We also ordered the heirloom grits with bleu cheese & the vegetable of the day which was broccoli rabe. After reading several other reviews I was expecting to be blown away by the grits, especially given my affinity for anything bleu cheese related, but in the end they turned out to still be much like what you expect from grits. I guess it's hard to turn some things into what they're not, but don't let that deter you from ordering them, they are still quite good, just not life changing. The broccoli rabe was the one mistake of the night. I have tried the vegetable before, and I know it is supposed to have some bitterness to it, but this serving was completely off the charts. It literally ruined my taste buds for the rest of the dishes, thankfully there was plenty of water to rinse with. Fortunately BDT redeemed themselves  with the two meat courses. The duck breast was some of the best I have had, and the layer of fat was absolutely perfect, with a great spice flavor. The confit was a little disappointing, and tasted sort of like duck BBQ, but it was still good. The braised beef was phenomenal, as it should be considering it takes three days to prepare. There is no need for a knife here, this meat just falls apart at the touch, and they even give you a spoon to get out all the extra sauce in the bottom of the pan.We were so full we could have easily stopped after the main courses and been content with our heavy caloric intake of the night, but it's just so hard to pass on dessert, especially when you can see them making the pastries as soon as you walk into the restaurant. We took the advice of another Yelper and went with the apple pie and the cranberry white chocolate ice cream. Both were incredibly delicious and a fitting ending to a very filling night.As others have said, the decor here is second to none in DC, and the atmosphere is great. Unlike others, our service was fantastic in both the lounge and the restaurant, and we got the table we requested right in front of the kitchen, which was a spectacular, unique view in such a nice establishment.",Justin C.

I have worked in a few restaurants, mostly farm to table with the same vibe but the Blue Duck Tavern has amazed me. The flavor profiles were thoughtful and delicious. Each course was presented in a great fashion and vied to out do the last. The cocktail list was well planned and the wine list was extensive without being overwhelming. In conclusion, my meal and service at the Blue Duck Tavern was good enough to coerce me into creating a yelp profile. Enough said.",Laura G.
1743,Seattle,2008-11-29,13Oz-YGYClR_-sMCsk1uYw,4, WA,"Very good.  Not five stars, but very good.  For appetizer, I got the mustard spaetzle ""Mac and Cheese"" duck confit, for my entree I got the crabcakes, and I also had some of the blue cheese grits and a taste of the sturgeon.  The crabcakes were not as good as the ones I've had in Baltimore, but they're pretty darn good and about as good as one is going to get in DC.  The mac and cheese was incredibly delicious.  The blue cheese grits were okay, maybe a little too rich, as I felt somewhat uncomfortable after eating a lot of them.  The sturgeon was decent, but nothing earth-shattering.The decor is pretty nice, if a little crowded.  They have an open kitchen, which is neat, and it's eerily clean.  The service was very good, attentive and encouraging without being officious.  They also offered plenty of non-patronizing advice about the wine, which I think is pretty rare.  It's definitely a fine restaurant, but given the price, I think there are better deals and/or more intriguing cuisines in DC.  I'll come back at some point, but not before exploring other places first.",Barrie C.
1744,Boston,2008-10-28,WwMDz503y0wKCJK57qPIrA,4, MA,"We screwed up. We were much too proud about our comfort with family-style eating that we misjudged our choices, which tainted our experience at Blue Duck Tavern. Get ready for it...Our meal was...mediocre. (Oh, it hurts...)I was so excited to come to Blue Duck Tavern last Friday that I had it on my profile for more than a week. After reading some of my favorite yelpers' reviews, I knew that we were in for a treat. During his week-long visit in DC, I wanted to make our one night out something really, really special. So we got dressed up, found the best parking space (avoiding the $10 valet fee) and got seated by some super friendly hosts right away.Alexander, whose sole job seemed to be to tell people about the menu in excruciating detail, came over and - you guessed it - told us about the menu in excruciating detail. Since it was our first time there, he explained to us how everything is served on casserole dishes that go in the middle of the table to share. He also highlighted a good number of dishes and told us a lot about them. Our server then came and took our order. Here's what I would change if I could: we ordered the Mustard Spaetzle ""Mac and Cheese"" for our appetizer, and for our entree, I got the Rack of Black Berkshire (pork), and he got the Braised Beef Rib. As a grits-lover, I couldn't help ordering the Heirloom Grits w/ Goat Cheese for a side. So let's think about it. Mac & cheese for our appetizer, and for our main course, we have a huge slab of beef, two huge slabs of pork, and cheesy grits. Can you say heavy? Can you say meat overload?? Don't get me wrong - the food was great. The mac was of course different than anything I'd ever had, the pork didn't seem to need any sauce or seasoning because the flavor was pure pig - delicious. The braised beef rib could be torn off the bone with a fork, and it was really tasty. The grits -omg, the grits! - were divine (though it failed to turn my dining partner into a grits lover, which I was hoping for...).Anyway, here's my advice. If you're going with a party of two, get an appetizer, decide on ONE entree, and get a number of the side orders. Not only is it a better value, but you'll really get to sample some of BDT's best, and you won't be on a meat overload like we were. We decided not to get dessert since our stomachs were practically mooing and oinking at us, but we were pleasantly surprised to get dark chocolate-covered apple slices with our bill!All in all, a very pleasant experience. Just be careful with what you order!",Ina C.
1745,Torrance,2009-04-05,mpQcaFHJ9l42Z0Th_c35oA,5, CA,"Impressive, beautiful yet unpretentious restaurant with a unique set-up of the open kitchen.  Kitchen is divided into several areas (apps, entree, desert, etc) and all within customers' view - but ONLY if you reserve a table with a requested view of the kitchen.  If you are a foodie mesmerized with watching the kitchen ala top chef, iron chef and other cooking shows - be sure to request a kitchen view table.  The focus of the menu is to use all fresh, local ingredients as the star of the menu.  All the yelp'in on the bathroom was over-rated, i thought.  And what's the deal with the very flowery perfume smell overpowering what you just ate??!?  BDT - hope you're reading the reviews???Service - pretty good but felt the wait staff was bit ""checked out"".  Gave good recommendations but service didn't feel genuine esp. with them knowing that it was our first time and from out of town.Must-Haves:1) Roasted ribeye with bone marrow sauce and 2) Mustard Spaetzle mac-n-cheese duck confit.  This will be on my list for my last supper.  The ribeye while I thought at first was little cold had just the right amount of flavor to bring out the best and with the bone marrow, it just danced in my mouth with decadence.  Mac-n-Cheese - a much grown-up mac-n-cheese and comfort food to the max.  Who would have thought of adding duck confit to the mac-n-cheese? Add some panko flakes on top - at least that's what i attribute the crunchiness to, it totally works and is a really warm-n-fuzzy dish that you must have.Others that were good but nothing to write home about:Winter salad of endive and watercress w/ hazelnut dressing and black truffle - Saw the dressing, saw the black truffle shavings, didn't really get much flavor out of the salad.  Fresh, pretty and decent.Nantucket Bay Scallops with Argon oil - I've heard about argon oil - how scarce it is, thus $$$ and the crazy production method (It's usually limited to Morocco and the story goes that these goats eat the olive-like fruit and leaves from the argon tree, poop it out where upon the undigested nuts are collected, cracked and then pressed for oil - yup - it's true).  Anyways - I think it was the combo of knowing the exotic background of argon oil with the fresh local bay scallops - combined with the wine - it was really good.Braised Swiss Chard - great local ingredients and sauteed just right.  Simple and fresh.Dessert - Almond banana cake  with maple cream - The density of the cake was not expected - very dense - but the flavors were really good and a nice way to end a great meal.  Enjoyed with a blood orange green tea - and while at bit pricey seven bucks,  cleansed palette and ended the meal with a high note.  We went on a Sunday night - and I don't know if it's DC that dies after dinner time or that we went on a Sunday.  BDT is located in a ritzy hotel area of Georgetown and all of the hotels were dead with no night life after dinner time...",Kelly K.

1748,Silver Spring,2011-02-24,Y78wEEVEgsr4VFvfBFkIIg,5, MD,"I am so impressed by the food at Blue Ducks. My boyfriend and I went for Valentines dinner after canceling our RW reservations 2 times. I cannot believe I had not been here before. The decor is impressive especially the big black doors on the entrance and the food was just one of the best I have ever had-impeccable. The palette is soo different it WOWED me.We got the Oven Roasted Bone Marrow bc it seems to be a favorite. It was perfectly cooked and the flavors were just amazing. It was a weird texture for my taste because its just fat inside, but that didnt matter to me at all. Braised Beef Rib was so tender it fell off the bone. The portion was perfect and the sauce it came with was also delicious. I could not stop eating bread dipped in the bone marrow and Beef rib sauce.We wanted to try something a little less complicated so we went with the crab cakes which were very good but it was probably best that I tried something I don't have much off. As sides we ordered the Wood Oven Roasted Jerusalem Artichokes with candied bacon. I have to admit I hate artichokes and I was a little annoyed that my bf picked them but I have to say they were nicely cooked. They are kind of hard which I wasn't expecting bc I have only tried them once or twice. I picked the Whole Grain Mustard Spaetzle ""Mac-n-Cheese,"" Duck Confit and I almost licked the plate. It was soo good I crave it almost every day. We also got the fries which were perfection but I only had one or two because I was sooo full. The waiter was impressed because we ate EVERYTHING in sight of us and had two bottles of wine. We were ready to pass out and have the happiest of dreams after this lovely meal.Generous portions, outstanding service, amazing food. I cant wait for my birthday to come back!",Paola G.
1749,Ashburn,2012-08-17,u9C1Nb6eQqfYM7q7LC6OXg,1, VA,"Party of four for lunch today. Ordered the Schnitzel with Mustard Spaetzle. You would think that the spaetzle was a side with the schnitzel, but alas, it was more of an afterthought with barely two forkfuls of spaetzle in the pan. Spaetzle should be tender - with a noodle-like texture. This was hard and some pieces even crispy, as if it had been in the pan in the broiler and fried on the bottom. While the schnitzel portion was plentiful (three cutlets), it was heavily breaded and quite salty. All our diners commented that the sauted spinach side dish was also very salty. Lobster salad as a starter was quite good - with lobster in the guacamole. Great presentation and good mix of flavors.Two diners had the Wagyu Steak Salad, which was beautiful on the plate. One noted that the salad had little dressing. Both the lobster and one steak salad included the core from the greens. Not something you'd expect to find at this level of restaurant.Service was fair, though we commented on the wait for refills of the water glasses.Lunch for 4 was $150 with tax and tip - so we had higher expectations.

1753,Washington,2008-10-14,jgCMwOPxSIUt6NW4OklqHQ,5, DC,"Often times, restaurant designers choose modernity over functionality.  The design on paper seems splendid, but when the restaurant is done, it is too stuffy, or too casual, or (gasp) too blase.  This is my feeling about the newly designed Corduroy.  The food is fantastic, but the atmosphere is both a tad stuffy and overly uninteresting for a restaurant of that magnitude.Blue Duck's designers, on the other hand, should be lauded for envisioning a place that is both invitingly proper, casually formal, and generally just warm all around.  Giant doors open into a lightly colored stage that looks out over much of the restaurant.  There is a beautiful hearth off center near trays of fresh bread that activate your salivary glands as you enter.  The open windows and patio make it feel secluded, despite the fact that it is in a high traffic area.  We ate out on the patio because it was such a nice night and it felt neither noisy nor as if we were being intruded on by pedestrian traffic.  The fountain's gush certainly helps.The food was also quite good.  The Yelptastic community recommended this place and it did not disappoint.  Highlights of the meal: the beet salad that had an amazing egg and something topping; the goat cheese grits that -  for a person who doesn't care for a grit, let along many grits - was so decadent and creamy; the main duck course with a crispy, pastrami like skin that perfectly complemented the supple breast meat; and the lamb.  Honestly, this is a treat of a restaurant and most definitely worth the money spent.  Thank you yelpers for your assistance in this find.  I will be going back!",Jack N.

1755,Arlington,2011-04-01,zWJ9yyEHGb-U_F7XDUvzEA,4, VA,"Not much I can add about the place. The food was top-notch and absolutely excellent. Some aspects of the service and overall dining experience kept it from achieving what I consider a five-star level for its price tier (i.e. flawless). The service needs a little work - a bit informal for the price range. And seriously - a 5:30 reservation and they're going to pull the old ""your table isn't ready"" nonsense, then seat a 5:45 party before our eyes? But when it comes to excellent, creative American food (locally sourced, of course), Blue Duck really comes through. I'm going to second everyone's recommendation on the bone marrow - it really was the highlight (and I thank all the yelpers before me for insisting that everyone try it!).Random side note, which I noticed when reading the dessert menu: has anyone else noticed that their text logo is an almost exact duplicate of the Burberry London text logo? Same number of letters on each line (eight and six), very similar font, same relation between the font sizes on the two lines, they even write ""B L U E D U C K"" as one word, with the same amount of space between each letter. The only difference is that Blue Duck uses slightly more pronounced spacing between its letters. I don't know why, but it struck me right away when I saw the logo - ""where have I seen this before""?",C. W.
1756,Lakeview,2009-03-05,sSNsI1ccaVOtnh56FrrlbQ,3, Chicag,"My husband and I dined here before attending a night with the Smothers Brothers at the Pops with the Symphony at the Kennedy Center.  We deliberately chose the Blue Duck to start off our evening on an elegant note.So we put on our fancy duds and made the hike down to the Kennedy Center.  Hopped in a cab to the Blue Duck.  Missed the fancy tall doors on the way in, unfortunately, but were seated right away for our reservation.  Had I realized you can't see the open kitchen from the entire restaurant, I would have specifically requested a table near the kitchen when I made the reservation.  We were seated in the near empty restaurant (5pm reservation) in a little alcove with two tables, facing the windows which face the street.  The atmosphere was more of a diner than fine dining as a result.  But - we ignored it and excitedly scanned the wine list and menu.We debated our choices quite a bit, especially since I had read lots of reviews and was curious to try lots of items I had read about.  In the end, we ordered the spring greens for a starter, the chicken and duck entrees, and the BDT fries, garlic mashed potatoes and daily harvest vegetables as sides.  That day's harvest veggies were sunchokes, and we had consulted the waiter to decide between those and the salsify, among other things.  He was quite helpful throughout the meal, as I am notoriously indecisive in restaurants.  (Alex was our waiter - nice guy.  Oddly informal for an upscale restaurant, but it worked for us, as we are not formal folks.)We had brought a lovely bottle of wine from our cellar at home, but in the rush at the Kennedy Center to get to our reservation on time, we left it in the car - DOH!!!  So we discussed our options with the waiter and decided on a pinot noir from Sonoma.  He had personal knowledge of the winery and its owner, and told us an interesting story about him.  The wine was pretty good, actually.  Went well with everything.So - the spring greens were awesome!  Salad isn't really something I usually think of as being unusual or interesting, but truly, I could have eaten these all night and been happy with nothing else.  I wish I knew what that dressing was, because it was perfect.The rest of the meal came when the greens were finished.  My husband doesn't eat duck, so that was really for me, and the chicken was really for him.  But we shared tastes.  His chicken was delectable - melt in your mouth delicious!  That's how chicken is meant to taste.  The duck - first let me say that duck is a relatively new experience for me, not something I have much to compare it to.  But I liked it.  The waiter was actually concerned because I didn't rave about it immediately, and offered to get me something else.  But it was just a new taste for me, and I needed to get used to it.  It was truly delicious, not at all greasy or gamey, as I have heard duck can be.The fries were disappointing.  I was really looking forward to them, as I had heard a lot about them.  But they were really just big sticks of potatoes, rather flavorless, nothing special.  The sunchokes were amazing - we both absolutely loved them.  No idea how they were prepared or how we could possibly duplicate that recipe, but we sure wish we could - completely awesome.  That waiter knew what he was talking about.But the true star of our dinner was the mashed potatoes.  Weird, but seriously, we were nearly fighting over who got to eat them as they began to dwindle in the pan.  I don't think I have ever had potatoes that delicious in my life.  Unbelievable.We were getting pretty full by this time, but there was no way we were going to pass on dessert.  Having heard raves about the apple pie, I wanted to try it, even though some other things looked awesome.  The waiter offered us a free bucket of ice cream on the side, so we also ordered the bittersweet chocolate sauce.  We also chose two glasses of a lovely dessert wine the waiter had recommended.  The apple pie was divine - huge!  I don't see how any single person could finish it alone.  The crust was perfect, the apples were sweet and delicious - the whole thing was just delightful.  The handmade vanilla ice cream was delicious, but the bittersweet chocolate sauce had us wanting to lick clean the cup it came in.  Sinful, mouthwatering - awesome.  We lingered over dessert and some decaf coffee.  I made sure to use the ladies' room, since I had read it was amazing (the reviews were a bit exaggerated, it's a nice bathroom, but nothing to write home about, and WAY over-perfumed).  On our way out the door we inquired about the cookies and were given a bag.  I wonder if anyone ever pays for those or if they are a gimmick they use to look magnanimous.Overall, BDT is a nice place to have dinner.  The food was nice, the dessert was fantastic.  I'd recommend it, but not sure I'd call it the best dining experience ever.  Nice place, for sure.",Kendall A.

Every one of our entrees were amazing, most notably the rib steak, the braised veal shin, and the crabcakes. The place is very warm and the decor is modern, but cozy. The bar and lounge area seems like it may host an obnoxious crowd, but comfortable enough to get a drink before your reservations. The restaurant itself is smaller, and the service is, I assume intentionally slow, but very responsive and attentive. Make reservations and prepare to be there a while.

1765,Houston,2010-01-02,n20U0eyxQnwiDujD3gCwWA,3, TX,"My first experience to Blue Duck Tavern was for brunch with a large group. We had a 12:30 seating.  We got a large table that was kind of tucked away in the back, which was nice and private from the rest of the dining room area.  The service was OK, but the 'team' of 12 servers that emerged upon our table, bringing each of our dishes out at the same, maybe was a little over the top. Our entire meal lasted over two hours, and I think it was waaay too long for just breakfast food.  Most of the people in the group had not eaten breakfast, and were quite hungry.  They kept bringing baskets upon baskets of the free hard, crusty type of bread they give you (which was meh), so we were pretty full by the time the meals arrived.  And now to rate the items ordered (since we all shared and sampled each):Chesapeake caesar bloody marySour dough baked pancakeBelgian waffle Scrambled eggs with scallops Lump crabmeat omeletteShort rib hashBDT friesThey do a decent job on the bloody mary's, but for $14, I would have expected them to.   I'd say everything was acceptable, but nothing exceptional. For example, the crabmeat omelette contained nothing but a little bit of crab meat with egg - no veggies, no cheese, no seasoning, nothing.  I'm not sure why everyone raves about the fries there.  They are really thick and come with some housemade mayo sauce or something, but certainly not an ""OMG"" kind of item. The baked pancake was way too thick and cakey, and the belgian waffle way too sweet.  The short rib hash is pretty good, but the biscuit that it comes with really needs some help.

The food was decent, the drinks were WAY overpriced and the desserts were disappointing. After dinner we went to the lounge area which had some cool areas to hang out, I can only imagine what sort of shady deals have gone down in the glass inclosed meeting areas.

The attention to detail is unparalleled - everything (and i truly mean everything!) was thought out to the nth degree.  Ask for Michael to be your server - he will treat your entire party as if you are visiting royalty.  And every morsel of food is perfection - you can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but I would suggest starting with the crabcake, having the to-die-for suckling pig as the main, and finishing with the unbelievable apple pie.  Bravo to the chef and staff at Blue Duck Tavern!  I can't wait to return!!!",Channing F.

1774,Chicago,2008-11-10,zSlG9L44MVRT-ZRmOkVCyQ,3, IL,"3-1/2 stars.I went expecting fabulous, but it was something less.  Good and enjoyable, but less than fabulous.The room is beautiful.  Warm and modern and totally unstuffy.  It LOOKS like a high-end restaurant.  Service had a kink or two, which is okay except when you are paying almost $300 a couple for dinner.  We had timing issues throughout -- nothing major, but for that price it should be better.  Example -- I like, and a good restaurant should offer, a cocktail when you sit down.  It took a long time for anyone to come to us, and before the waiter took our cocktail order, bread was delivered to the table.  Odd.Food was hits and misses.   Take the warm beet salad, for instance.  The beets were good, but the blue cheese was minimal, the ""lardon"" was just a slice of bacon, and the egg ran so that the bottom of the bowl was a soupy gloopy mess.  My boyfriend had the spaetzle mac and cheese with duck confit for starters.  It had an overwhelming mustard taste that overpowered anything else.Entrees fared better.  My boyfriend had the pork shoulder and I had the smoked duck breast.  Both were delicious, truly.Sides -- buttered cabbage was a big hit as was the pumpkin gratin.Desserts were good but nothing stood out.Don't get me wrong -- I had a really enjoyable evening here, and the restaurant has a great vibe.  It's just that for the price, I expected something superb, and I was just left a little deflated.",Hugh B.
1775,Alexandria,2010-07-31,2NGVbrlWtUfCwJ5u9TT18w,5, VA,"Oh, my my.  Oh, hell yes.  You got to put on that party dress and head over to Blue Duck Tavern.  If I hadn't only recently dined at BRABO in Old Town, I would say that this was by far the finest meal I've had in recent memory.  As it is, it is one of two of the finest meals I've had in recent memory -- and the ambiance here edges out BRABO.Blue Duck Tavern is guh-orgeous, inside and out.  We were lucky enough to score a table on the beautifully appointed patio, but we took our sweet time walking through the restaurant to get there.  The dining room is impeccably decorated with marble, sleekly mod wooden chairs, crisp table linens, and alluring, bright, fresh produce standing in for floral arrangements.  The kitchens are open to the dining room, so you can watch the staff as they cook and plate BDT's culinary masterpieces.  The patio is equally well-thought-out, with a fountain spilling down over Mediterranean-blue tile, chimineas punctuating corners, and cornflower wicker tables and chairs.  Adding to the luxuriant atmosphere of Blue Duck is the wonderfully professional service.  From the moment you walk in the door and are greeted by a bevy of beautiful hostesses in smart black suits, you are made to feel like your every wish is BDT's command.  Everyone is most pleasant and welcoming.  Much like BRABO, Blue Duck's staff moves in a near-silent orbit of perfectly honed hospitality, so that you're almost unaware of what's taking place.  Although you *are* well aware that you've wanted for nothing since you sat down and everyone who's approached the table has been utterly gracious and unobtrusive.Topping it all off is the fantastic farm-to-table food.  Our party tried the bone marrow appetizer as well as the single crab cake with mustard and fennel.  The marrow -- like meat Jell-O -- was mild and mellow, but a bit too daring for some.  The crab cake, though small, was nothing but jumbo lump meat, fabulously fresh, with little detectable binder.  For dinner we tried the scallops, cooked to silky perfection; the braised beef rib, tender, falling off the bone, and complemented by rich homemade steak sauce; the duck breast with duck meatballs, rare and buttery breast, slightly spicy and exceptionally seasoned meatballs; and the toasted Alaskan spot prawns, sweet and mild with a nice acidic tomato broth and smoked paprika tater tots.  Entrées are à la carte, so we also ordered polenta with mushrooms, BDT fries, baby romaine with green goddess, and summer succotash.  Highlights were the duck fat fries and the succotash -- both swoon-worthy.  Finished it off with the famous apple pie (big enough for four of us to split) with homemade ice cream.  To die.Only gripe (and it's a personal one) is with the cost of alcohol.  Most cocktails are $14, and hardly a bottle of wine on the list is under $40 -- I understand this place is swank, and I love; I'm also sure not gonna forgo alcohol with my din, but throw a girl a bone.  Our bill came to......A LOT.  Worth every penny, but it prohibits coming back on the regular like that guy in the white blazer who showed up and was slapping backs with the waitstaff, regaling with stories of his recent trip to the Riviera.  (Cocktails *were* fab, tho...)[15 Minutes of Fame: ""Unique Eats: Brunch"" and ""The WETA Guide to Fine Dining""]",Mac O.
1776,Washington,2009-01-07,oWLe4hyMJdiqZAp_oykAUA,4, DC,"Came here for some cocktails and snacks one night with family and friends. First things first, they have the coolest doors to this place - they are like 20 feet tall! It's like you're opening the front door of a castle from a Disney movie or something. Once inside, you immediately feel warm and welcome - the decor here is very inviting. They have a big open bakery-type kitchen in the center of the place and it looks to me like a true French ""boulangerie."" Walk to the left and you've got a nice bar, although somewhat awkwardly shaped (it has two parallel bars w/ about 5 seats each, and a whole bunch of wasted space in between - perhaps intentionally). They have these cool ""private"" dining rooms that are see-through glass - I know this because I almost walked into one (slight hazard?) I think it's pretty cool that you can be seated in your own little private room that is quiet, and yet still catch the scenery of the restaurant and the hustle and bustle. They also have a cool cheese table w/ a big leg of cured pork sitting on it - I was salivating and was very happy when my family ordered the cheese sampler to snack on. I want to eat here, despite the fact that it's in the West End which is technically further than I generally go to hang out. I'm definitely intrigued enough to break my rule of not eating at hotel restaurants because this place is cool!",Liam D.
1777,Washington,2007-12-02,wNWl3HkqidLAjtNs1DPwtA,4, DC,"4.5 starsI love Blue Duck -- wonderful menu, outstanding service, generous portions.....The food is really wonderful. Pumpkin soup was outstanding. Scallops and rack of pork were delicious and the portions very generous. Mashed potatoes were excellent as well. The food is not overcomplicated -- there is a simplicity and honesty that lets the ingredients and wonderful preparation shine. The wine list is decent -- good variety -- and good selections for various price points. I thought my Conundrum at $10 bucks a glass was a little expensive -- but was then surprised by the generous pour (which was probably at least six ounces).Service was very attentive, though not without lapses -- but felt very well attended to but never intrusive in anyway......very sincere and genuine.Never made it to dessert as the portion sizes didn't leave much room for dessert.I liked the ambience a lot, but am not a huge fan of the tables and chairs -- but overall I would recommend Blue Duck without reservation.Will return.",Tom D.
1778,Atlanta,2008-07-03,UGOGpVVHHyStVUViHv5z9A,3, GA,"Eeeek... this is a toughie. I'll start with the good:This was, by far, the most striking restaurant I've ever been to in DC. Soaring ceilings, very open space, lots of glass and light wood accents: it's absolutely beautiful. The patio outside is the perfect spot to dine al fresco, with the fountain overpowering the street noise, but still quiet enough to actually hear your dining companions. The food was equally phenomenal. The menu is quite large, with lots of options to please everyone. I had the scallops, my dad had pork chops, we split the goat cheese grits and also got boston lettuce salads. The salads were great: very mustardy and a sign of good, fresh, high-quality food to come. The scallops were awesome: big and just barely seared so you could really enjoy their texture. My dad raved about the pork chops, and the grits were some of the best I've had (and trust me, I've had a lot of grits). I was happy to see they imported them from Anson Mills, SC-- best grits in the world. As good as all of this was, the wretched service absolutely overshadowed the entire evening. We had an 8:30 reservation but arrived about an hour early, seeing if we could be seated earlier. We were perfectly happy to sit at the bar for an hour, but the hostess told us they would definitely get us in quickly, long before 8:30. She also informed us she'd come get us at the bar when our table was ready. So far, so good.The service at the bar was a bit substandard. There was no welcome from the bartender, just a couple of incomplete menus (pages obviously missing) plopped down in front of us. They were out of the first two wines my dad chose, and it took nearly 15 minutes for the bartender to tell him this. After about an hour, my dad and I were pretty positive that the hostess had forgotten about us, so we told another bartender about our situation. She was very helpful, went straight to the hostess stand, and came back informing us that our table was ready whenever we wanted it. Yep, they had forgotten about us.When we came back to the hostess stand she asked if we wanted to be inside or outside, and as we walked to the patio we saw 5 or 6 open tables, both in and out. There was no apology that she had forgotten or any acknowledgment at all. Once we were seated our waiter came over. The rest of the night our service was slow, our waiter was haughty, and we didn't feel like they appreciated our business at all. When you're in the service industry, this feeling is vital.As we made our way outside to get my car from valet, we noticed there was no valet present, and no one at the hostess stand. I finally tracked down a guy and told him that we needed a valet attendant and he assured me he'd tell the hostess. 6 or 7 more minutes later (it had been about 15 by this point), my dad went back inside, found a manager, and told him about the problems we had that night. When you're going to charge $10 for valet, you better have a valet attendant hanging around. One of the guys we talked to was incredibly apologetic (he may have been a headwaiter? or service manager?) and assured us that he'd talk to his team. The other manager (this other guy's boss) was just about as haughty as our waiter. As I said, the food and the space were absolutely top-notch, but I'm a little wary of returning for a special occasion due to complete lack of quality service. I hope that the folks at Blue Duck read through some of these reviews to find that this is a pretty big problem for them, not just a fluke as the manager had promised us last night.",Kathleen M.
1779,Kirkland,2007-10-01,eCQuyb6csRIMlXcmhzJ0pA,4, WA,"Gorgeous modern decor, stunningly delicious food, so-so service.  The vegetable kebabs with goat cheese grits were amazing ($14, I think).  Each vegetable was a perfect package of freshness, flavor, and color.  The grits were mild and complex,  a lovely foil for the brightness of the vegetables.  The fava beans with chantrelle mushrooms were exquisite ($13), and I hate fava beans. My husband's fois gras and duck sausage ($ !?!) was delicious, and surprisingly not fatty in texture or gamy.My friend said that her heirloom tomato salad had the best tomatoes she's ever tasted.  We went for brunch and my other friend said that the eggs Benedict was tasty as well.The cherry blossom ice tea came with simple syrup for sweetening.  It  was clearly brewed with care and excellent leaves. The coffee ($6!) was very good, but not worth $6.  Go to Vidalia if you want a high end cup of joe that's worth it.My husband's apple pie ($7) was not a slice, but a full dessert plate  sized pie, with perfect crust and caramel on top-- delicious.  Friend A's carrot cheesecake was unbelievable. The crust was a very thin, dense carrot cake that brought out the creaminess of the cake itself ($7).  Friend B's  vanilla and strawberry ice cream ($7) was huge, but they went a little overboard on the ""home churned"" angle.  The huge chunks of ice felt more freezerburned than rustic.  The smooth, rich, dark chocolate sauce ($3) helped matters, but not quite enough.The service was a disaster for this class of restaurant.  There were extended periods while we sat with empty drinks and no server in sight.  Bread and freezing cold butter arrived about 30 minutes after we placed our orders, and 5 minutes before the food came out.  I randomly was given a plate about 20 minutes before anyone else.  We didn't really mind, because we were having a laid back day, but I would have been an unhappy camper if it wasn't brunch.  For this reason, I have to remove a star, despite the brilliance of the food.The coup de gras was my dessert--marscapone custard with fresh marinated cherry topping ($7).  Inventive, beautifully prepared, this dish was a revelation.  A hint of star anise flavored the deep red cherries, emphasized by the light color of the custard.  The texture was flawless and the flavor perfectly balanced.  Overall:  Come here!  Come here! Come here, but on a day when you have plenty of leisure time.   Don't let waiting indefinitely for servers  tarnish your enjoyment of the food.  This food deserves better.",Andrea U.

1781,Rockville,2009-08-29,6ZRpP8CHz98rLdC4EBke5A,3, MD,"Blue Duck is not what I was expecting.  Its place is light, hip, and modern--I was expecting a pub type, dark restaurant attached to a Hyatt Hotel.  Service staff is clearly well trained.  Almost too service oriented so that we felt stifled by the attention and forced feeling of the service---example, no, I do not need an escorted tour to the ladies room.  The service outfits for waiters are inappropriate--navy full suits for a guy that is trying to reach around and move plates/glasses???? I get the 'Blue' but scale it back to a practical outfit.The crabcake is excellent--almost all crab and no filler. Very high quality.  Other parts of the meal fell short--the sushi appetizer was bland (pickled watermelon was refreshing), the beet side dish was under cooked.  Its clearly high quality food inputs, but the flavors and preparation fell short.  For all the hype--I was expecting REALLY good food, which Blue Duck was not.",T G.

1788,New York,2008-08-06,UsEHuoQlxA29i1zcx0hMPA,1, NY,"Let me begin by stating that this review is for the Sunday Brunch at Blue Duck - not their dinner.My experience began circa 12pm on a Sunday. A couple of friends of mine wanted to meet for brunch/lunch at Blue Duck (they are big fans of dinner there) and had gone about setting up reservations for our party via OpenTable. When we arrived at the restaurant the hostess could not locate our reservation and we were left to wait for close to 15-20 minutes while a table was prepared.  Luckily they have some comfy rocking chairs in the lobby so we were mildly appeased by this. After loudly talking about how they could have lost our reservation and mentioned to one another comments such as ""How long could it possibly take to set up a table"" we were finally seated.The menu wasn't the greatest nor the worst menu I have seen for brunch. I was expecting a little more but overall there were a few things that caught my eye. Our server - some young lad with a really horrible fake French accent took his time getting to us even though it was apparent we were ready for drinks. He swung by and took our drink order. We didn't see him for another 10 or so minutes. By the time our drinks had arrived we were parched and quite ready to order. By the time the food arrived we had gone through all of our drinks and refills on the water and most importantly the alcohol were no where to be seen. Apparently there was some VIP next to us because god knows they were getting a lot better service than us.When the servers brought our food, they delivered the entrees to the wrong persons and we were forced to reshuffle the plates and sides - totally unacceptable in my opinion.  They did not even mention the names of the entrees as they put them down - they just went ahead and dropped them wherever they wanted. Luckily for us, the food was rather tasty and I did enjoy the mushrooms. Our check came to be $150 for three persons - a bit on the high side but still less than the $80 brunch at the Four Seasons which is phenom-gorge (includes alcohol). This brunch did not include alcohol.It is unfortunate that the horrible service and experience will prevent me from going back to Blue Duck. I think I'll stick with my usual Brunch at the Washington Monarch though I think now it is called the Fairmont. At least there the servers are attentive, polite, and ready to provide quality service.",Alvaro P.
1789,Los Angeles,2008-09-29,-tnuAJPisbtC-VVAmodINw,4, CA,"A colleague and I took a job candidate out for an interview lunch, which seems to be a popular use for this venue.  I'd heard mixed reviews about this place, mostly related to the service.  We, however, had no service-related issues.On to the food.  We started with the bresaola and a green salad.  The bresaola had a nice flavor; the greens were peppery and well-dressed.  On to the entrees.  I had the roast chicken, my colleague had the scallops, and our candidate had the braised short ribs.  We shared the carrots and the fries as sides (the sides are served family style, as were the appetizers).  The carrots were terrific.  The fries could've been better.  I would go with something else.  Next time, perhaps I'll try the roast mushrooms (if they're still on the menu).  The chicken was very, very tender and juicy, and well flavored with a hint of tarragon and a nice lemony jus.  I picked up only a touch of the rosemary sprig that was on the side.  Dessert:  I had strawberry rhubarb ice cream, colleague--the goat's milk custard, candidate--banana peanut butter ice cream.  I also had a cappuccino.  The cappuccino was inferior in a way that tainted the rest of my dessert.  The milk was scalded and I'm not sure what sort of espresso they were using.  As for the ice cream, the servings were colossal, the flavor acceptable.  The strawberry rhubarb was sweet and creamy but really nothing to write home about.  The banana peanut butter wasn't that great, and I didn't chance the custard.  Next time I think I'll try the apple pie (again, if it's still on the menu).  I saw some cooling in the open kitchen--by the way, Blue Duck is a nicely designed space--and they looked delicious.Anyway, it's one of the better restaurants around my workplace (I'd rather  be closer to Metro Center, these days), so I'm sure I'll head back and update my review once I've tried more of the menu.",Jon E.
1790,South St. Paul,2014-04-10,LJ--1iB5uFXNfuRfGUDMGA,5, MN,Excellent food.  The duck breast confit and grits were amazing.  I can only complain about price but then again there aren't many places to get food like this!,Michael C.
1791,San Francisco,2010-07-05,BYdf9yPZgKe5wpJgMbUsbA,3, CA,"OVERALL: Great decor, okay service, and mediocre food for the price we paid. I'm concerned that so many people rated Blue Duck Tavern. At first, I thought something was wrong with me, but then I thought, maybe reviewers are influenced by the hype. I was between a 2 and 3, but I'm giving Blue Duck a strong 2.5 stars...unfortunately Yelp doesn't allow half stars so I'm rounding up to 3 stars. MY MENU: Blue Duck serves food family style, so I got to try a lot. --Scallops (Appetizer): 3 small-medium sized scallops. Yes, they were good, but not $5/pop good. I would order them all the time if they were much cheaper, but given the price, I wouldn't recommend this.--Braised Beef (Entree): For something they're famous for, it's only okay. I think may expectations were way too high. Yes, I agree that the meat was soft and melted in your mouth, but there the portion size was three small cubes of meet on a bone. For $24, I'm not sure it's worth the hype.--Duck (Entree): Of course I ordered the item in the restaurant name. While the spicness of the meatballs was interesting, the six sliced pieces of duck was a little too tough and not nearly as flavorful as I expected. I actually took one of my three piece share and gave it to the other person I was with because I didn't find any value in adding it into my stomach.--Fries (Side): The fries were supposed to be fried in some kind of duck fat or duck something or other. However, it tasted like a potato was sliced, fried slightly, and some salt was put on it. Because so many raved about this and I know it's the most popular side, I can't tell you how disappointed I was with this side.--Polenta (Side): The person I came with insisted we get vegetables. While the corn was crunchier than I expected (in a good way), it was a pretty unmemorable dish. I don't have complaints but I have nothing good to say either.SERVICE: I judge service by how often my water is filled...and I drink a lot of water. While my short glass was filled often in the beginning, I did have two times where my glass was empty and I had to stop eating because I needed to wait for someone to fill my glass with water. Also, I wanted ketchup for my fries because the garlic sauce wasn't cutting it for me. Even though I waited a good 20 minutes for my waitress to even realize I had been calling her for 20 minutes, and even though my waitress checked on the other two tables next to mine in this 20 minutes but didn't even glance at me, she ended up chatting with the table next to mine after I asked for ketchup. The sad part is that she made small talk with them for a good three minutes, which may not sound bad, but I I was obviously waiting and had not eaten for awhile waiting for the ketchup. It's one thing to make customers feel heard, but she could have wrapped up the conversation faster. Furthermore, I think she forgot about my ketchup. Her wait-partner came 6-8 minutes later asking if he could take my plate and I said I was waiting for ketchup. He went out to get it. On his way out, I think my waitress realized she forgot about my ketchup as she had waited on other tables in the meantime and I think that's why we got complimentary sugar cookies in a nice blue tin at the end of my meal. And let me tell you, those sugar cookies were good! Certainly better than the giant sugar cookies I like at Potbelly's. The small sugar cookies tasted healthier and lighter than regular sugar cookies and, I dare say, were the best part of my meal...of course, it probably affected my opinion that they were free.  If this was their way of telling me sorry, then great...I just wished they told me that's why I got the cookies. DECOR: Everything is so clean: the Wizard Of Oz -like tall doors, rocking chairs, and peaceful fountain in the outdoor eating area. I kid you not, I think I saw some kind of royalty eat outside and I didn't think it was weird.  It was also nice that I could wear jeans with a nice blouse and still fit in sitting next to people more fancy than I was dressed. Also, I liked the open kitchen and the ability to walk by the dessert-making section on the way to the bathroom...which was pretty awesome because you get your own personal bathroom in each style, fit with your own toilet AND your own sink.",Christi D.
1792,New York,2011-01-27,_rfWPfvbKTrk6w1VVr7RRw,4, NY,"The architecture and design of this restaurant is stunning. From the huge entry door, to the open kitchen, to the unique glass rooms, this place screams trendy and contemporary. I can see how some people could find the layout a bit confusing. I suspect that the restaurant is split into two areas. A drinking area on the left and a dining area on the right. When my bf & I arrived, we were led to the drinking area to wait for our dining table. There was a bar but also tables with waiter service. This side seemed empty, quiet, and a bit pretentious.Once we got to our dinner table on the opposite side, however, we could see that the restaurant was bustling and crowded and not as snooty as the other side. Our waiter on the dining side was so sweet and really helpful with recommendations. The food here ending up being amazing. The standout dish was the bone marrow. I've had bone marrow before and didn't understand what the hype was until I had it here. Trust me & get it!! The cauliflower soup was also good & the braised rib is pretty good too. The rest of the food we ordered was really decent but nothing mind blowing. Overall, I'd come back here for sure! If not for the bone marrow, then to try all the other interesting things on the menu.",Josephine L.

Wine was superb (and decently priced) - Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc made by Duckhorn called ""Decoy."" It went really well with our poultry selections: the duck (duh!) and the chicken (so juicy!). Also had sides of the french fries (must try) and arugula salad (splendidly simple). The dessert was out of control - we had the homemade ice cream. Definitely get this to share - 3 large scoops come in a big glass jar. The strawberry was amazing. Vanilla (with honey, I think) was outstanding. Not a big coffee ice cream guy, but the espresso flavor was good too. Definitely coming back to try the bone marrow, crab cakes, and braised meats.",Andres P.

1795,Littleton,2008-01-29,hD91-c8AaOqOZ0TudaLLdQ,5, CO,"The Blue Duck Tavern is excellent in many ways. The atmosphere is dark and modern, but not pretentious. The large windows made it feel more open and the dark wood tables also added to the nice feel of the place. One little complaint I have is the daintiness of the glasses. Geeze, I felt like I was going to break the water and wine glasses if I only added enough pressure to them. They were definitely thin as hell.Anyway, the Blue Duck Tavern also excels in the service. The wait staff is friendly, informative and not overbearing. I didn't even have to ask to get my water glass filled because they actually paid that much attention to your table that if your glass is even half empty they will fill it up again. The idea of serving food at the restaurant is also different. For a restaurant of this caliber, I expected the typical one dish per person with several side dishes ordered extra. Instead, their food is served a la carte, so sharing food is and very much recommended. This lets you try out all their dishes without feeling bad about sharing plates at such an upscale restaurant. To start off, the crab mac and cheese was a little unexpected at this type of restaurant, but they managed to do it just right. It was creamy, and just cheesy enough for me. There were actually large lumps of crab in the dish, and plenty of it. They definitely don't skimp out on the crabmeat. Needless to say the rest of dinner was incredible. The grass-fed steak was cooked to perfection, and had a nice and charred crust. The Boston sole was flaky and flavorful, although I wish more than two fillets were included in the dish. My hungry ass wanted more of it. The sides did just as well...baby greens and sweet potato grits. Again, everything was served family style so I got to try out all the dishes in one plate. Same goes with the dessert, which included the peach and mango crumble as well as the chocolate cake. As expected, it is a bit pricey but it's well worth the quality and taste of the food, as well as the attentive service. You'll leave feeling very satisfied and full.",Chris F.
1796,Washington,2008-07-09,PhUGu2k-0hxXNI9HTchccw,5, DC,"Well it was good. Very good. The staff was on their toes, overfriendly, just as you would expect a high end restaurant to be. Eager to please, they are very careful and treat you like fragile glass. ""watch your step."" Apparently people have tripped on the very obvious steps into the dining room because they get distracted by the mirrors, the ceiling, the setting, the glass encased table which creates an intimate illusion of privacy. The food was scrumbdiddlyumptious. Usually vegetarian, I even ate the meat. A lot of it. My stomach hurt afterwards. But the reason i'm writing this review is for the bathroom. For the ladies bathroom it is a hallway, with six to 8 doors leading into a little private bathroom for the customer, complete with a sink and thick towel/napkins. Little did the designer of the bathroom think that excessive privacy in bathrooms may screw up Girl Strategy 101, go to the bathroom together and gossip in front of the mirror.

1803,Rockville,2007-06-01,pXNfAxsQHgf5TaY-F6wflA,4, MD,"I had lunch at Blue Duck Tavern today and was very impressed.  Ambiance and decor get five stars.  The interior was designed in what one of my lunch companions called ""mid-century meets Zen"" - lots of wood, simple lines and big windows with lots of light.  What I liked best about the ambiance was that for a fancy schmancy restaurant it was surprisingly unpretentious.  The wait staff was very friendly, though a bit slow.The food was also good, though it didn't knock me over as much as the ambiance/decor did.  I got a spring pea soup with morel mushrooms that was a shocking shade of green and tasted very fresh.  It was almost too simple, like fresh pureed peas with almost no flavor added, but I enjoyed it.  For my entree, I got the tuna tartare with field greens.  The tuna tartare was also good but like the soup, the flavor was a bit too mild for me.  It was interestingly topped with a raw quail egg.One of my friends got the scallops, which came in a metal dish with huge pieces of scallops on it - I tried one and thought it was very tasty.  We also got baby carrots and the goat cheese grits for the table.  The carrots weren't that exciting, but the grits were awesome.  Fluffy and cheesy.Warning: The bill was astronomical.  We paid over $200 for four people for lunch!",Betsy T.
1804,Washington,2008-09-08,RgWNYu0k80Uy4mvZW3uKuA,4, DC,"I took my husband here for a special birthday dinner last week, and we both thoroughly enjoyed the experience. A few notes:The Atmosphere: The restaurant space is light and airy, with soaring ceilings and large glass windows overlooking their outdoor patio, but the rustic dark wood furniture and open kitchen overflowing with fresh produce and a roaring oven lend warmth and coziness. We asked to be seated at a quieter table, and were given a table in a relatively private nook with another table that remained empty until we were finished with dinner. The rest of the space seemed pretty noisy with chatter, but we had no problem having a distraction-free conversation between ourselves.The Food: Fantastic. We had foie gras as a starter (alas, no bone marrow on the current menu), followed by braised beef and crab cakes with sides of gourmet mushrooms and the most heavenly goat cheese grits I have ever tasted in my life. The foie gras was very good, but didn't blow me away. The braised beef was very good, tender and falling off the bone, but again not a life changer. The crab cakes were moist and tender and just stuffed full of fresh chunks of crab meat. The mushrooms were divine, and well, I've already told you about the grits - I really had to stop myself from licking the serving bowl. Overall, not overly complicated food with lots of big fresh flavor. Alas, we did not have dessert, but based on the faces of those around us who did, it is not to be missed.The Service: Perfect. I was a little worried by some of the complaints lodged by other Yelpers, but the staff treated us so well from start to finish. Our servers were prompt, helpful, and friendly, and the little touches they added to celebrate my husband's birthday were very thoughtful and generous. No complaints.Overall: Four stars for a delicious meal, impeccable service in a lovely, sophisticated space. Worthy of a special occasion when you want a meal that is decadent and sophisticated but not obnoxious or overly complicated. We'll definitely be back again - after all, we still haven't tried that infamous bone marrow.",Sandy C.
1805,San Francisco,2007-06-26,YYYalIsJ_NkGCd2hbJ6YgQ,4, CA,"We have been visiting DC and were looking for a place to eat and hopped onto Yelp to see what was nearby our hotel. I normally hate eating in hotel restaurants, but I really loved this place. As others have noted, there's a separate entrance, so you don't even feel like you're in a hotel. We were able to eat outside, which was great. The garden behind us seemed to be in the process of growing some herbs and tomatoes, perhaps for future use in food. I appreciated that they noted the local origin of each type of food, emphasizing the freshness of the ingredients.Food-wise, this was great. One vegetarian entree, that was delicious, a great butter lettuce salad, and sauteed leeks and cheesebread as sides. One person had pea soup, which was a little salty, but reportedly the crab cakes and scallops were fantastic.Bathrooms were clean, restaurant had a nice ambiance, but the service was somewhat slow. I don't mind having a leisurely meal, but I felt that it could have been more attentive.Good drink list and a decent variety of alcohol.I did bring my kids (aged 9 and 7), but they are veteran diners, so I don't know how it would be for other kids.

I was particularly intriqued by the bratwurst and sauerkraut on the menu. Being from Wisconsin, it's rare to see a good old brat on the east coast. But being from Wisconsin, I also know it's hard for an east coaster to beat a Wisconsin brat. The Blue Duck did it. This was by far the most incredible brat I have tasted. Tender, succulent, perfectly seasoned. It melts in your mouth. Sigggh. I've had brats all over Wisconsin, in Germany, in Denmark. I've brated around. Blue Duck. You beat them all. I'm, as soon as I finish typing, off to make my Restaurant Week reservation for the Blue Duck Tavern. Gotta have another brat.On another note, I booked this reservation through Open Table and had no idea that the offering for Christmas was an $80 buffet brunch (oysters, shrimp, etc.). While I love to eat, I've never been a fan of the buffet. I just can't eat that much. I politely asked the manager if my party could simply order the items offered on their entree menu for the brunch and be charged for these a la carte, and we were courteously accomodated. I'm a big fan of fine food, but an even bigger fan of fine service. I'll be back.",Susan F.

It's definitely pricey but the service is fantastic, I honestly felt like royalty dining there because of the attention our waiters gave us. The food is also fantastic, but like a lot of places in DC they seem to do certain things very well but other items on the menu were just okay. My boyfriend ordered the chicken biscuit sandwich which he loved.The biscuits here are fabulous, and can be considered a meal in itself. I had the frittata and didn't like it at all. First of all considering it's just an omelet with some broccoli rabe and goat cheese a la carte it shouldn't be $15, that's just overpriced. I was hoping when I ordered it that it would have come with bread or potatoes at the very least but instead the waiter showed up with a tiny little plate of eggs. So nix that choice if you come here. The standouts in my opinion were the grits, very yummy, and the biscuits. The apple pie was okay in my book, I didn't like how dry it was but I did enjoy the fig and cognac ice cream.I think what really elevates this place is the service and some specific food items, not everything off the menu is worth ordering.",Jackie N.
1813,Seattle,2009-05-15,6qEnyXhK5pY7on90T-gc4w,4, WA,"Generally I snub hotel restaurants. Usually overpriced and under executed, but that wasn't the case with Blue Duck Tavern....it was a refreshing change of pace from ""standard"" hotel dining. Before I start on the meal, decor, etc... I must get my gripe out of the way. We called on Friday hoping to secure a reservation for 4 people...only thing available was really early or really late so we decided to dine elsewhere. Well the next night JP and I decided to give it another shot and he calls them up again, same deal...really early or really late, but since it was just us we decided to take the 10PM reservation with the promise that they would call us if something opened up earlier. Well, upon arriving at the restaurant there were a TON of open tables (set, not like they just turned over), both on the patio and inside. I was a bit frustrated and expressed it to the hostess who seemed to brush it off. If you are trying to be a high-end restaurant it is about the service and the food. The front end didn't deliver on the service. The decor is rustic modern with an open kitchen, high ceilings and shaker furniture (didn't dig the seat cushions, felt like I was back at my Aunt Fran's). Our table service was 5 star all the way... he answered all our questions, provided recommendations and was truly outstanding. The food was okay...we split the whole fish (which we asked for deboned and it still came out with a fair amount of bones), 1/2 order of the crab cakes (could have eaten them all night), cheddar grits (trust me...these are good! I lived in the South for 4+ years and never liked grits...these were cheesy, creamy and perfect) and a side of carrots (meh). Other than the crab cake nothing bowled me over about our main course... but the dessert did!  We ordered the apple pie and it comes with a side of vanilla ice cream....orgasm in your mouth! We asked for part of the dessert to be boxed up and our server presented us with the to go box and bag, complete with some Blue Duck Tavern cookies!  That was a nice touch.  I am glad I had the experience but not sure if I would make this a staple restaurant if I lived in DC.",Amy K.

The food was on par with CityZen and better than Komi for less money.  They don't have a tasting menu, so we ordered a few starters, mains, and sides and shared.The restaurant has an excellent wine list with several great options by the glass.  Probably the best wine list in DC.  I'd recommend the Ramey if you want a well balanced, full bodied red wine.

1821,New York,2008-10-24,fgwlZCHUqD794j8fnxLqjA,3, NY,"This is a beautiful restaurant located in West End. The entrance is off of a major street, so it's nice and peaceful as you approach the big blue doors to go inside.  Once inside, the restaurant is very tranquil -- high ceilings, nice open space, good street view, not too loud at all.I love the interior, and how the kitchen is open. To get to the bathroom,  you actually walk through the kitchen itself, and chefs are there working.In regards to the food, everything was of top quality. My problem, however, is that it simply didn't taste amazing. Take the starters, such as the ""fisherman's soup,"" which consists of one small cup of fish broth, two mussles and one clam. At 9 dollars, one would expect some fish...not just three (small) pieces of shell fish. To be blunt, it just does not taste incredible either, and even worst, the broth isn't served all that hot. The entrées are better, but again, not fab.  Take the beef short ribs, considered by many to be the standout entree. They are tender, and delicious, but frankly are they any better than the short ribs at Daily Grill?  It would be hard to discern between the two in a blind taste test. To hone down this point, the scallops are tasty, big, and fresh, but the fennel sauce really throws off the subtlety of the scallops, and it is a dish that could easily have come off the menu of another restaurant that is of ""lesser quality."" As for the sides (which are all al la carte), the garlic mashed potatoes are creamy, but where is the garlic? The other sides were also ""vin ordinaire,"" especially the fries, which are crispy and good but pale in comparison to the frites at Les Halles.The desserts are a mixed bag. The ice cream is really delicious, and it is served in a freezing bowl with a salad serving spoon. The chocolate fondant cake is also fantastic, and the presentation is terrific. But the caramel custard lacks the creaminess and sweetness of a delicious caramel custard and its presentation is average at best.In short, the food is of high quality, but the presentation and flavors are a mixed bag. Furthermore, the items on the menu lack a creativity that other restaurants of similar quality offer. The chefs here played it safe (a couple of beef dishes, fish dishes, a pasta...) and they can only be paired with similarly boring sides. Many lesser quality restaurants offer similar dishes.As for the service, it was extremely attentive, but they made plenty of errors -- dishes were served to the wrong people (or didn't even come out at all until we told them), and what really bugged me is that they served the coffee and tea well after we had finished our desserts.  All in all, this is a fine restaurant, and you will certainly not be disappointed. However, if this restaurant were in NY, Paris, San Francisco, or LA, it would be considered quite average. I love DC, but the food here is really not up to the standards of those other great cities, and this restaurant, which is considered one of the best, confirms this belief.",Andrew L.
1822,Cambridge,2009-05-06,c335bWPkstkTp3ihV-Ayqw,4, MA,"This is one of my favorite fancy date places in D.C.  The ambiance is relaxing and the decor is cool--a modern take of rustic. I love the open kitchen and the fact that you can watch your order as it's being made. (Contrary to every Gordon Ramsey reality kitchen show, it's not loud at all.)The ambiance and decor is of course secondary to the food, which is stellar (contemporary american). They have an amazing duck, their steak is phenomenal, and scallops are really good, too. OH! And their crab cake dish is one of the best I've ever had, which actually means something for a Baltimore native. I dream of their crab cake--the crab meat to bread crumbs ratio is heavily in favor of the crab, which is chunky and sweet. Portions are decent sized, as well--whenever I go, I get an entree and split one or two sides for a table of 4.Minus one star for overpriced wine list.",Kim C.

It was very very good though, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent meal. Some of the sides were a bit off -- the bacon and beans sounded greet but tasted odd, and the Mac & Cheese (or Blue Duck's very fancy version) was kind of dry. But the beef rib was outstanding, as was the crab cake. Service was also very considerate, although a little slow. They make up for slow delivery with free drinks, snacks, and dessert, which left me very happy and very full. For the money, this is a great place.

1827,New York,2010-06-30,tl9mw5qMa6no0NLMMt9mng,4, NY,"I finally made it here! It only took me like, 2 years :) How did I make up for it? I had duck fat fries and a duck entree! Hell yea!Yays:- I'm always a little skeptical with braised beef because sometimes its not as good as people claim it to be. They aren't lying here, its realllllly realllly buttery soft :) *MELT*- So when we got the frog legs appetizer, I was a little like hmmm, because I like frog legs but its not usually something my eyes sparkle for. It was arguably the best appetizer :p- Yes, as I said, how could I resist not getting duck? :) It's the name sake dish! The duck was very yummy but I didn't understand the spicy meatballs that came with it. I could handle the spice, but it overwhelmed the dish and didn't really go with the duck much at all. If they had left the meatballs out and put something else instead, I think it would have been a lot stronger.- Melon Martini - Fresh fruit + (fresh?) alcohol? Yes please! :)- Our red wine was delish :)- Yummy ice cream!- The service was impeccable and very friendly, and I loved the space of the restaurant. It was airy and unpretentious but very classy at the same time.- Yay duck fat fries! They were so good we had to get 2 orders. Nays:- I didn't love the apple pie, even though it looked delicious. I thought it was all right...- The candy bar fois gras was all right. It was strangely sweet AND salty - but in such a way as if it couldn't decide which one it wanted to be! My friend described it as tasting like BBQ pork buns haha...- The bone marrow was juicy and good but a wee bit on the salty side and the rabbitt rillette was kind of bland to me.",Ellen L.
1828,McLean,2010-06-30,38AiKCVMr8-SelgrRhIAvw,5, VA,This is my favorite restaurant in DC. My husband and I have been going there occasionally - for special and semi- special occasions. Staff is always very polite and professional. They also recommend great wine that would go with your entree. The restaurant is decorated with modern yet classic furniture. Its decoration reminds me of a lot of restaurants in Seoul - very clean and contemporary. We always dine in the glass room - Lincoln. This is as great as it gets when it comes down to creative American cuisine.  The only complaint that I have is that they no longer offer my favorite chocolate cake that came with flames on top of it... The bill always comes fat BUT it is worth every penny you pay.,Kelly H.
1829,Dana Point,2012-01-28,ytDhl4kTdp-vbrut5QMOnA,3, CA,"I was expecting much more given the hype and positive reviews.Ambiance: I did not like the wood chairs, it felt like a country kitchen to me instead.  We were seated near the windows which were drafty.  The atmosphere just didn't match the prices and the food.  Tables where we were seated were very close together and I could hear easily hear the conversation of the people next to us.  Seating was very uncomfortable.  I was on the bench seating so couldn't lean back or I'd be too far away from the table.Service:  Service was excellent and the best part of the night.Food: Food was good, not great.  I really didn't like the way the food was served...in baking pans and we had to serve onto our plates ourselves.  I also didn't like the a la carte sides.  I'd prefer the chef to pair sides that complement the main dish and then have it all be served to me on one plate.  Given the prices, I should get a nice looking plate of food.My husband loved his foie gras appetizer, but it was very small (even the waiter noted how small it was).  I had the special app which was risotto with shrimp.  This was a big miss as it was runny and was more like rice soup.  We ordered the two main dishes that the waiter pointed out.  The beef rib was good, not great.  I had the scallops and they were gritty and just kind of boring.  For sides we had the goat cheese pie and potato puree which I thought was the best part of the meal.  For dessert, the apple pie is GIANT...good, but just apple pie.  The cheesecake in phyllo was really good but the cherries that were soaked in some kind of alcohol tasted like really strong cough medicine so I had to work around those.Overall we had a nice time.  The service was excellent and the food just ok.  My biggest problem is still the atmosphere, those wooden country chairs and having to serve my own food.  Go here if you like basic nicely prepared food, but you won't find anything inventive.",Patrice L.

Brunch was insanely delicious but dinner was mediocre at best this Monday. I did enjoy that they have a ""mocktail"" menu. A pregnant lady can sure appreciate a hand crafted non alcoholic beverage. I had the lavender lemonade, delicious! We ordered a simple salad to start which was delicious and lightly dressed with buttermilk dressing. For our main course we had the crab cakes and salmon their fried and wild mushrooms. My crab cakes were super bland. I was disappointed in them. My husbands salmon was delicious, he really enjoyed it. The fries tasted like air. Without the aioli they were a total miss. I think some sea salt would have went a long way if you ask me. Wild mushrooms were good. I'm giving them 4 stars bc the customer service was great and I do love their brunch. I most probably will never be back for dinner though.",Mrs. Linda J.

After checking out the so-called ""Best"" spots in DC we were a little underwhelmed. However, I think we found our favorite so far - Blue Duck! The dining experience was fantastic - the service: impeccable, the food: unique and delicious, the drinks: try the banana mango cocktail!. We loved the family-style appetizers that made it easy to share all portions. I had never had bone marrow before and it was nicely prepared. The dessert was a little status-quo but I'm not one to judge a restaurant on its pastries. However, again, I cannot stress how great the service was. It was the best we've had since moving to DC. GO HERE!",Chrissy G.
1833,Vienna,2011-05-08,jdjpx73MO6NpiLhvVhNIew,5, VA,"I thought Blue Duck Tavern was fantastic. My friend had been telling me about the duck fries which were quite amazing, but everything else we had was even more delicious. We started with an appetizer of pea soup and bone marrow. This was the first time I had had marrow and it was the right place to do it. Really amazing, served with toasted bread and roast garlic, so good. For the entrée, we had braised short ribs and the duck breast with a side of the legendary duck fries. All of them were fantastic, especially the duck breast. They cook it in a wood fired oven and the skin gets an excellent smoky flavor. We finished off with the apple tart (very good) and homemade vanilla ice cream (really good). The ambiance of the place was fantastic and the service was very good. I will definitely be heading back. I also want to try the bar where they appear to have an awesome selection of cured meats and cheeses.",Brian S.
1834,Sumner,2011-10-24,iTXrJDZPktGG4F-AyO0aXg,5, WA,My wife and I were in DC for our 5 year anniversary and stayed at the Park Hyatt.  Based on the reviews here and elsewhere I decided to make this our special dinner out and we were not disappointed. I made our reservation several weeks out and it's a good thing because I checked later and they were booked all night. When we arrived we were immediately seated.  The server was very nice and told us about the specials.  We started with the Seared Foie Gras which was excellent.  It was silky & creamy and much better then what I had tried before (in Paris).  For the main course my wife had the Wood Oven Waygu Beef.  The meat was very tender & succulent and the sauce & shallots were a great pairing.  I had the Braised Bison Shank. It started off a little tough but softened at the other end and had a great flavor.  The bone marrow that cam with it was great. My wife even liked it and she doesn't go for those type of things.  For sides we had Creamy Polenta with Blue Cheese and Braised Escarol.  The polenta was very good and complimented both our meals.  However neither one of us liked the escarol.  It was much to sharp and bitter and we couldn't eat it.  When the server asked about our meal we told her about it.  She immediately took it away and replaced it with collard greens which were good.  She also took it off our check and gave us a tin of cookie as well.Overall it was a great dinner.  It did cost more then a normal night out but I don't think it was unreasonable.  If we are back in town I do think we would go back.,Philip B.
1835,Washington,2013-08-24,DLw1VS4XhQYu7HJkDJSQwg,5, DC,"Amazing food and service. One of the best places in DC. I highly recommend the duck and grits or polenta, they are incredible!",Allison C.
1836,Washington,2008-09-07,El-qCIIXV5EFZ6tUGe0koA,4, DC,"This restaurant is cool. How cool? Cool as in when you go to the bathroom, you walk through the very open kitchen (not even a counter separation between it and the rest of the restaurant), stand in front of what appears to be a wall, press a button, and the wall slides open. And yes, the ladie's bathroom is split up into individual stalls, each one with their own large mirror and sink area.But enough on bathrooms! On to the food!Free Bread: Points for soft butter in a substantial amount. Nothing worse than little hard tabs of butter. Minus points for cold bread. I'm a big fan of hot bread and soft butter, so this was just eeeh. Not that the free bread basket should sway someone's mind, but still...if you're going to be paying this much, it's good to know!Crabcake appetizer: Done very very well. Crab meat was appropriately large enough with filler being appropriately small. Remoulade sauce was lick your plate amazing. As Blue Duck Tavern is probably too cool of a place to do that, I instead opted to wipe the sauce off with my bread and eat it that way. Very yummy. Price is still a bit steep however with you getting only one crab cake for $15. Tomato Salad Thingy: I didn't actually eat this, so instead I will say that the presentation on this dish was incredibly pretty. Food Gourmet magazine pretty. Beef Short Rib: Enough has been said about this dish on other Yelp reviews. But in case you're too lazy to read the other ones (and have somehow grasped onto only mine for who knows what reason), 5 pieces of meat on a giant bone. Mmm....fall off the bone delicious. With excellent jus. Well worth $23.Grits with Goat Cheese: Aaaaagggghhh...so amazingly buttery, melty, good. Not gritty or grit tasting at all! Would it be wrong for me to go back and only order a side of grits? Amazing deal at however much it cost. $8?  So good. Get it. Now. Mail me some. Dessert: Chocolate Custard...is..huge. No really. It's huge. Half of it is still sitting in my fridge. I don't understand how that thing only cost $8. At a bakery somewhere, that would be at least $15--and trust me, I stalk bakeries. Light custard and surprisingly not overly sweet as the bittersweet chocolate shines through. Is also actually better the second day around after having sat in my fridge.Ice cream: Again, I didn't try this...but there is a lot of ice cream in that bucket they bring out to the table. I suspect that my partner and I were supposed to share desserts instead of each ordering our own. But ah well. More happiness and yummy in the tummy for everyone. Service: Excellent. Good wine recommendations with the meal. Water glasses appropriately filled before they got too low. Escort to the bathroom. Folding the napkin of the person who had left for the bathroom so it wasn't in a pile on the table (I'm a fan of this). Plus the take home bag for the leftovers was no cheap plastic bag either.Overall, not a bad deal. This is essentially simple food done right. In other words, a raising of the bar as to what food should taste like when cooked properly. Prices were definitely reasonable (especially for the large desserts and entrees....I mean really, 20-25 is not bad for a main course) with the possible exception of the appetizers. If I were going to do it again, I'd skip the appetizer and just tack on more sides.",Ting W.
1837,Washington,2011-12-28,pmY4xcoRfW8ViQxZT7UYyw,5, DC,"Blue Duck Tavern is hands down one of the best restaurants I've dined at in DC. In aiming for fresh, local ""new American"" cuisine, it succeeds where others (ahem, Founding Farmers...) fail.From the moment we walked in for our lunch reservation, there was a warmth about the place that felt cozy and inviting -- not a feeling I usually get from expensive restaurants. A delicious smell wafted from the open kitchen as we were seated. The service did not disappoint from the get-go, with the hostess bringing small stools to place our purses on.Our server was polite, attentive, and very knowledgeable about the menu, which changes by season. I was happy to see that many of the dishes were sourced semi-locally. I decided to make this lunch a veritable feast, so I ordered the Roasted Beet Salad, the Black Rice with Long Neck Squash, and a glass of the sauvignon blanc.The salad was absolutely amazing -- the perfect combination of beets, sliced apple, walnuts, goat cheese, and endive. Luckily my entree was still piping hot when I tasted the rich flavors of squash, black rice, and candied chestnuts. As a vegetarian, I was delighted that the chef did not simply treat the vegetarian entree as an afterthought, as many do. I would definitely come back just for this dish! We finished off the meal by sharing the Pecan and Date Tart (with vanilla bean custard) which was to die for. Absolutely delicious.My only complaints come in some of the logistical aspects. I expected my salad to come out first, but it arrived with all the entrees. While not a huge deal, I wasn't thrilled because I was worried (needlessly, it turned out) that my entree would be cold by the time I finished the salad. It took a while for our food to show up in general, though this could be because our dishes were being prepared carefully, not on an assembly line. My portions were well-sized, but my companions both ordered the Jumbo Lump Crabcakes, which, though delicious, were neither ""jumbo"" nor plural (only one crabcake). We were also charged double for one of our drinks, which was easy to fix. The service in general was outstanding.I almost never eat at hotel restaurants, but Blue Duck Tavern exudes the hospitality of an upscale hotel without feeling like you're in one. The price tag, while hefty, is worth it for the wholesome, made-from-scratch taste of the dishes. That said, I won't be able to dine here more than a couple times a year. But when I do, it will be an occasion.",J L.

1843,Washington,2009-02-24,uKZ3LcyMmJzg_bVUBqtEdQ,4, DC,"Went for dinner last night and after reading very mixed reviews on the place. Some people love it others hate it, I think it's on the DC top-10 restaurants list.  While it is not 5-stars, I will say I am picky and very few places get 5-stars, it was very good. Walking in through the 20ft wooden doors you are welcomed by a friendly hostess who takes your coat and matches it to your reservation so there is no claim ticket. You are then taken to your table, be careful to watch your step there are multiple levels. The modern lines of the dining room and matched with the dark woods is very visually appealing. We ordered drinks and they bring over the glasses without the mix (if you order a mixed drink) so you can see the quality of the pour. My Makers and Coke was 74% Makers then she poured in the coke (well Pepsi, almost took a star away for not having coke at a bar...). The menu was very expansive and had a great selection of appetizers from a broad range of types. Their entrees all sounded appetizing and it was a difficult selection to pick just one. I will have to go back and see if I can have repeat performance. This time I selected the Cassolet and it was amazing, I think it was the best cassolet I have ever had, maybe even better than Central! Also I really liked that they have an open kitchen you can walk through and see the final preparation. We skipped dessert but I am sure they were also very good. All in all I will 100% return to Blue Duck to try different things and since it is so close to my office I am sure I will wind up here for lunch as well.

As a bit of a restaurant snob I am not opposed to spending a good amount on a nice meal; with the caveat the food is exceptional. This place sadly did not meet the standard. The ambiance was phenomenal: the layout is bright and open- so open you can see the cooks preparing the meals- and the wait staff was extremely polite. The wine list, albeit ridiculously overpriced, was impressive. The menu had many specialty dishes. And the deserts were to die for.As for the food, both my date and I got the Kansas Grass-Fed New York Strip, which was tough and lacked taste. The fingerling potatoes with bacon were salty and greasy. The artichokes with duck ham were edible. Thankfully the mixed mushrooms were chewy and flavorful, and the desert made up for the lackluster entree.At $100 per person I would have thought the food to be a bit better; however in a city that lacks interior aesthetics I guess our bill covered the opportunity to be in a newish trendy restaurant.",Rebecca M.

NOW, it's rare that i give out 5 stars on yelp, but the kindness and the thoughtfulness of hosts? you got me there.anyhoo, besides the GREAT service, the food... where do i begin?they didn't set aside a different pre-fixe menu for restaurant week, so we got to try many of their items on their regular lunch menu, for only 20 dollars per person!everything, i mean EVERYTHING we had on our table was amazing. from appetizer to dessert, we couldn't get enough.  one item that i can't forget was their chilled squash soup - perfect for a humid summer day in DC.AND when the runners come out with your food, they synchronize to put down all of your plates at the same time.  it was almost like watching a performance.. and we felt like queens.another thing --- their completely open kitchen! very impressive. it was an interesting play on going into such a classy, upscale restaurant yet being greeted by their friendly staff and the open kitchen to have such an intimate experience.if i ever do make it back to DC, i'll make sure i'll make it back to Blue Duck!",Rina K.

We tried two of the desserts too - the cheesecake with fresh figs in a phyllo pastry and the apricot, blackberry, almond crumble.

My wife and I went to DC for a few days to see the sights and we have been reading in the last year or so that DC has become one of the great food cities of the US. Everything I have read is true. For our second night in town, we ate at the highly reviewed Blue Duck Tavern. The main reason I wanted to eat here was because of the their roasted bone marrow dish. Amazing!!!! This wasn't the first time I had a bone marrow dish but the one at Blue Duck tavern blew everything away. My wife ordered the soft shell crab app and it was also very good. For the entree, I ordered the the grilled whole Branzino (Mediterranean Sea Bass). It was cooked perfectly but there was very little sauce and I thought is was lacking a little flavor. My wife ordered the braised beef rib and it was so tender you could cut it with a fork and the sauce had several different layers that made it highly complex. Our Sides were  the hand cut BDT triple fries cooked in duck fat and roasted green asparagus with duck egg bearnaise & duck prosciutto. This meal was nearly perfect. I would go back anytime.",Joshua C.

I feel extremely confident in saying that every course was one of the best things I've ever eaten. And the service was simply amazing. We started with the roasted bone marrow and beet salad. Then moved to halibut and suckling pig with charred lettuce side. Ended with the apple pie and strawberry/rhubarb shortcake.  My wife ordered every special I ordered chef signature dishes. Both strategies resulted in an incredible culinary experience.If you love reality cooking shows or have worked the line you'll appreciate how this kitchen operates, a perfect machine. Yelp is wrong about attire and kids! There's an extremely expensive hotel attached and they won't bat an eye if you show up with 4 kids and everyone is wearing jeans and flip flops, they'll just assume your staying at the hotel and would never dare offend one of the guests. I saw hamburgers and fries being served to kids that were playing iPads at the table, so it's not super fancy, although they may prefer it to be. I eat out a lot with my kids so it's another thing I love about this place.",David S.

However, when my hubby asked where I'd like to go, instead of my usual ""surprise me"" answer, I asked for Blue Duck.Another amazing experience. I have been to some of the very best NYC restaurants and the service here is top 3. They really go that extra step to make sure everything is perfect. We sat outside which was well worth the extra wait since you can't reserve an outside table. Last time we went we asked our waiter for his recs and went with those. We did that again with our waitress and same result. FANTASTIC!Apps - since we can't eat alot (small ppl) our waitress rec not getting one from this column but rather save room for dessert.Main - The Beef Rib was literally melt in your mouth good. There was also a sweet tang to it which I enjoyed. And they let me take home the giant bone (plus some) for my pooch. The Rabbit was awesome as well. Although the breast was a bit dry, the leg was falling off the bone juicy. Would have ordered the Duck but we had that last time.Starch - how could we say no to fries fried in duck donfit, so we didn't and it was everything we expectedVegie - We decided to try to the Sheep's Milk pie which wasn't on our waitress's list of recs and it wasn't our favorite. Will go with the cucumbers next time.Dessert - they surprised us with the chocolate cake, which luckily I had left two bites worth of room for.  SO GOOD!!!!I don't think we'll be waiting another year to visit Blue Duck again :)",Sally H.
1880,Westbury,2013-08-31,-zhp6Ld8XSE2VBRHPWcJJQ,3, NY,"After reading about how fabulous this place was we had to try it especially since we were staying at the Park Hyatt.  The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Our waiter seemed distracted but was friendly enough. Our mixed drink was made with ingredients that weren't listed on the menu and when questioned the waiter fumbled through an explanation saying the ""bartender"" was in a mood of ""just winging"" the ingredients. Hmmm just soda then please. Yes, this seriously happened. We ordered the NY Strip opting to have the béarnaise sauce on the side as well as the mushrooms. The order came out all wrong. One had the béarnaise on the steak w/out mushrooms, and the other came out w/ sauce on the side and mushrooms on top. I cant even excuse it as the kitchen being overly busy. The steak itself was meh. It was pretty tough. I really was disappointed. I've bought, cooked and have eaten better steaks for the amount I paid for this dinner. The fries however where delicious along with the homemade mayo and ketchup. We did get dessert. We got the raspberry chocolate cake as well as their signature apple pie a la mode. They where all Nom Nom. Fabulous raspberry purée and that surprise layer was delightful. Apple pie had a gorgeous caramel top which complimented the slightly sour apples, along with a bit of that über creamy vanilla bean stuffed ice cream...oh we fought each other for the last bite. Heaven. Our room came with complimentary breakfast and we loved it more than the dinner! The Belgian waffles, fluffy yummy goodness, omelette filled and cooked perfectly, and last the beef rib hash with sunny side up eggs, was probably the least favorite as it was salty and it just wasn't all that tasty. Bottom line go for the breakfast and dessert, much better fare.",Winns S.
1881,Alexandria,2010-12-18,08H7ypKfwASXosKQcTT6RA,4, VA,"This was a really solid meal, but it really adds up.We dined here last night and enjoyed all of our dishes.  We started with the bone marrow and lamb belly as apps.  The bone marrow was buttery goodness and pretty plentiful in comparison to other places I've had it (three large bone halves).  The lamb belly...what can I say, it wasn't pork belly.  It was good, but not as fatty and flavorful as it's porcine friend.  For our mains we ordered the beef rib and the roasted chicken.  Everything is a la carte (hence the really adding up), so we added on the mac-n-cheese and jerusalem artichokes with candied bacon.  I'll go in order of preference and start with the mac-n-cheese.  Definitely not typical it was mustard spaetzle with cheese and duck confit and there was lots of duck confit.  It was really duck with some mac-n-cheese and it was very good.  The roasted chicken was brined and cooked perfectly...it was very simple, but that allowed you to taste the gameyness of the bird, this wasn't Purdue, it had the taste of chicken that was walking around outside earlier in the day.  The beef rib was beautiful to look at, very caveman, and it was tasty, but nothing the blew me away.  Similarly the artichokes would have shined if there was enough candied bacon for each bite.  The combination of the bacon and roots made for a great bite, but there were probably 5-10 little cubes of candied bacon, and many more chokes.We went with the pumpkin cheesecake for dessert and were quite surprised when 3 wonton like purses arrived.  It was pumpkin cheesecake and it was quite good, and I liked the surprise.  Others might not...so be forewarned...they were playful with the desserts, at least ours.The room was inviting and the service was very attentive.  No complaints in that regard.Overall we had a great experience, but I think for the price you could do better elsewhere.  We might come back and eat at the bar for lunch sometime, but I doubt we'll be in the dining room again anytime soon.",Mike R.

I loveeee it! As for the entrees, I've tried the muscovy duck breast and the braised beef rib. The duck is pretty good, but the braised beef rib is even better. It's so tender and savory that it's a must try. For dessert, we always order the apple pie with vanilla ice cream, you can't go wrong with this!

1888,Washington,2010-10-25,agnVRulXSBH6vyf1tnINrQ,5, DC,"I am once again worried that my writing wont do BDT the justice it deserves...My meal last night was heavenly. Wait, I meant to say that my experience dining at BDT was heavenly. This is because of the attention paid to detail-from the courteous, perfectly attentive service to the smart spacing of the tables in the dining room (the effect is as though you're getting all the attention yourselves; plus you can actually hear your companion's conversation) to the sprinkling of pomegranate seeds atop the Cheesecake, itself one of the most memorable desserts I've ever had. So, let's start with dessert. The best part of the meal, we ordered two because we couldn't bear to try any less. The Crispy Figs w/Mascarpone Cheesecake & Port Glaze. And the Chocolate Cinnamon Ice-Cream. Unexpected, the Cheesecake was barely recognizable except for its mascarpone filling. There were three little sachets of pastry filled with mascarpone & fresh figs, bursting w/flavor. A drizzle of pomegranate syrup topped it off. The Chocolate Cinnamon Ice-Cream was also wonderful, a large serving at 3 scoops & served in a frozen glass bucket w/ a wooden spoon. A lot of food, I felt sad about leaving one lonely, lovely sachet on the plate but simply couldn't fit anymore in. When our server came to clear the plate, I remembered to ask him about the tomato preserve that was listed below the ice-creams on the menu. I had never seen tomato preserve before on a menu anywhere, and wondered if people usually have it w/the vanilla ice-cream... A minute or two later, he brought some for us to try, along w/ vanilla ice-cream. On the house "" because you asked about it"",he told us. Another reminder of why Blue Duck Tavern is so special. For the main dishes, my companion and I shared the fish of the day and the duck. We also ordered the aforementioned fries (see previous review) ,and a starter under ""soups, salads, and vegetables"". It was the Caramelized Blue Hubbard Squash Custard, dried fruit, spiced pumpkin seeds, sage. Very innovative flavor-wise but just not something I would order again. Way too sweet, except maybe for dessert. When I think of Blue Duck Tavern, I think FRESH, creative, farm-to-table. I think sophisticated, sustainable. It's not at all surprising that this restaurant won one of ten best hotel restaurants worldwide last year. What is surprising is that each time I dine here, I am reminded of why the experience of dining out can be such a a joy.",Jeannie O.

They were plenty big also.  The beef ribs though were seriously good.  They were cooked in a nice sweet sauce of some sort and they were so tender that it felt like a great piece of filet mignon going in your mouth.  I would highly recommend getting this dish!!!  You won't regret it.We finished the evening off with their apple pie and homemade vanilla ice cream.  mmmmmmm, wish I could repeat this dining experience every week.",Will W.

All cooked amazingly.  The fries were as good as advertised and the special harvest vegetable of the day, leeks and spring onions with bacon were truly delicious.  I am not a sweets fan, but my GF loved the strawberry and rhubarb cobbler for dessert.Lastly, I highly recommend the ginger melon martini and ice wine. Larry our server was awesome too!",Doug S.

I was in Washington DC for a business trip and selected Blue Duck Tavern based on Yelp reviews. Best meal and best service I've had in a long time. Going out to eat at ""New American"" restaurants quite frequently when traveling for work has caused me to be a bit of a food snob. Every meal tastes the same...boring. That is, until I had the spinach salad, ribs, and apple pie at this wonderful establishment! Ambiance and decor (both indoor and outdoor), awesome...food, terrific...and service by Edwin, unparalleled at this price point. I was raving about this place for weeks!

1899,Seattle,2009-09-04,kOjA46ux2_htQEXL8T43TA,4, WA,"Top 10 Reasons to try the Blue Duck (when there are so many other great restaurants in DC):1) Servers who know their stuff.  Our server had great recommendations on the food, but he also doubled as wine sommelier: we asked for recommendations in the $50-$75/bottle range and he asked if we'd be open to trying something outside of the pinot noir varietal.  We looked at him incredulously, because I was pretty sure that I wanted that Willamette Valley Pinot that I always look for, but agreed to a blind taste test.  He brought out two choices with very different qualities, and we unanimously picked #2... turns out that #1 was a $125 bottle of pinot noir, while the #2 that we loved was a $60 bottle of syrah!  ""I just saved you a bunch of money,"" he exclaimed (not sure I can remember EVER hearing a server say that before, isn't it usually the opposite?!)  I can guarantee I've never ordered syrah in a restaurant before.  But we ended up enjoying not one, but two bottles with our meal, so I suppose that in the end the cost came out about the same.  (Good thing we were walking home!)2)  Bone marrow.  Seriously, where else in the ConUS have you seen bone marrow on a menu?  Not common.  I loved it.  Maybe it was the garlic cloves that came with it or the perfectly buttery toast it was served with, but that bone marrow was a big hit.  My father's only comment was ""Now I see why the dog likes it!""  Riiiight, Dad.3)  PRETZELS!  Because no Weisswurst is complete without them.4)  Extremely shareable meals.  Great for groups of friends or dates, so you can share around and sample some of everything.  There were three of us, and all the plates came out cut into three pieces. You can discreetly pass the small casserole dishes and no one will know the difference.  For the record: the braised beef rib was the winner of the night, though it was a close race with the Tavern steak.5)  They had both green AND yellow chartreuse.  Our server didn't really know what it was (neither did I!  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch… ), but the bartender turned up a bottle and my dad was thrilled with his green stuff.  Not my thing, smelled like cough syrup and Listerine, but if you're into unusual liqueurs produced by monks in remote places.  Or just pretending to be sophisticated.6) Open kitchen.  I loved the scenic stroll to the restrooms, right past the pastry station.  There were all these miniature apple pies lined up that made me think of that story where the kid steals the pie from the windowsill - I could totally be that kid.  Oh, and that brings me to #7...7)  Honest to goodness All-American apple pie.  Beautiful flaky crust, delicious cinnamon apples, all in a miniature version.  No pathetic slices here.  They serve you the entire pie!  Of course, no pie is complete without......8)  Hand-churned ice cream!  We got a bucket (really, a little bucket with a wooden spoon!) of the house made vanilla to go with our apple pie.  I could have died right there a very happy woman.  With skyrocketing cholesterol, no doubt, at this point in the meal.9)  Pretty wood tables.  Cool rustic-chic decor.  Did I make that up?10)  Last but not least, certainly not least for the ladies among us anyway, they had bathrooms with sinks.  Like, many sinks.  One sink IN each stall!  No one to watch you clean your teeth... you get the picture.  The ultimate in private restroom experiences.  If that list hasn't convinced you that you need to eat here, I don't know what will.  Oh, maybe the fact that you get 1,000 dining points for making a midweek reservation through Open Table?  Which means that you're 1,000 points closer to eventually winning some kind of prize.  I really don't know what the prize is, but I like to win things.  So get over to Open Table and make a date to check out this place soon!",Amanda M.

1914,Washington,2009-07-22,4YHNHDauxWMGc22On1JD2A,5, DC,"Wonderful experience!  I read the menu before going and was not super excited, as it looked more like an autumn or winter menu to me, with braised and roasted comfort foods that are heavier than I like to see on a summer menu.  However, I am more than happy to eat braised short ribs, cheese grits and roasted bone marrow in July if that's what they taste like.  The bone marrow is served with a head of roasted garlic for spreading on the croutons...which is both delicious and convenient if you are married to someone with a garlic allergy.  The ""amuse"" was a handful of heirloom cherry tomatoes dressed in oil, vinegar and dill.  Gorgeous and simple -- plus, our wonderful waiter brought us refresher tomatoes that we could enjoy between bites of dinner.  The cheese heirloom grits are the most delicious I've ever had -- sort of like spoonbread or pudding, with the slightest texture from the hominy.  Not only that, but we didn't order the grits because they have garlic in them, and they just came out anyway as a little bonus.  We also had the seared scallop and cauliflower appetizer, the striped bass with razor clam and fennel, the swiss chard and raisin pie and the french fries.  The scallop and fish were both perfectly cooked.  I found the pie a little too sweet.  The fries are adorable rectangles stuffed into a teeny little stainless steel pot and have the texture of steak fries.  Not my favorite kind of fries, but they grew on me, especially as an accompaniment to meat because of the crispy outside and fluffy interior.We were too full for dessert and there was still orange-almond birthday cake at home, so we'll have to try their handmade ice creams and pastries another time.  Our waiter thoughtfully sent us home with a bag of BDT rugelach as a treat, though.As should be clear by now, service here is incredible.  I can't tell you how many different members of the staff greeted us.  Our waiter was warm, funny, gracious and accommodating.  I was ogling the chairs at our table from the minute we came in and I was trying to figure out if they were original Cherners or knock-offs.  My husband snuck a peek as the hour grew later and then we discussed with the waiter who immediately flipped a chair over and investigated for us.  For any other design nerds who care, they are reproductions of the original Plycraft chair but with an upholstered seat.  They are manufactured by the Cherner Chair Company still in operation today.  Needless to say, the modern, airy interior was very much to my liking.  We were also pleased to be seated right by the open kitchen, which is run expertly.",Constance C.

The service felt snotty though, with hostesses who, although nice to look at, did not understand English very well and were not well-informed on the menu or wine list. I have no qualms with a place trying to create a certain image, but clients should always feel welcomed and employees should know what they're talking about. That said, the food was very well done. I normally avoid chicken in restaurants, but I tried their organic chicken and it was both moist and tasty.

The decor is very unique, with mission style furniture mixed with ultra-modern elements like clear glass cube walls surrounding dining tables to give a little privacy. (sound privacy at least)We had a drink at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and carried our drinks over to our table for us when it was ready. We sat down and immediately our server came over. We ordered a ton of food... I love duck and everything sounded so good that we definitely ordered too much food, but it was worth it.We got duck rillete and king crab mac & cheese gratin for appetizers. Wow. The duck was good, the mac & cheese was AMAZING.For dinner, we had blue foot chicken, new york strip, a side of bacon braised brussels sprouts, and sweet potato grits. Everything was really good, but what really sticks out are the brussels sprouts. I don't honestly like them that much, but I think I could eat them everyday if they were braised with bacon. They were amazing.For dessert we got Caramel Cheesecake, Roasted Pear, Cranberry Sauce and Banana Milk Chocolate Custard, Peanut Tuile. Both were really good.

1927,Washington,2010-07-18,iDe7l0gsDONBIa91wPYQYg,5, DC,One of my favorite restaurants in DC. I've been twice and both times the food was spectacular. Although the restaurant is in a hotel it doesn't seem like it at all. the atmosphere is great - both in the restaurant and bar area.The food is very fresh and the menu changes with the seasons. Order an entree for yourself and sides for the table - the mushrooms and fries were amazing. Save room for dessert. Their homemade ice cream is amazing. I ate too much the second time I went and ordered ice cream to go! I didn't think it was possible but I had to ask and they were very accommodating. Great for a fancy date or even for groups since you can share a lot of the food. FYI - the parking situation in this area of town is less than ideal. Try to take public transportation or a cab so you dont have to valet.,Ann W.
1928,Washington,2012-09-03,lV_9DSzSxO8YffepBSOJFw,4, DC,"I took my boyfriend here for his 25th birthday and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. I called ahead (which is a must do for this popular restaurant) and told them it was a special occasion. They gave us a great window table, the hostesses and each server took the time to stop by our table and wish my boyfriend a happy birthday - which was really nice! The food was amazing and we both loved the setup of the restaurant. The main centerpiece of the restaurant is the kitchen where they serve all organic products. The wine and cocktail list is extensive and I love that they have several options on the menu. Great venue for a change of scenery from the typical DC eatery. The only thing that could have made this a 5 star experience is if the restaurant was easier to find, I could have made a reservation at an earlier time but they were all booked, and if the atmosphere was a little more intimate rather than having that ""hotel restaurant"" feel.",Austin W.
1929,Washington,2011-01-18,9vOugNbWUaDF3GsICFlEUA,4, DC,"We had lunch at the Blue Duck Tavern today, a part of Restaurant Week in DC.  We were impressed!  The service was very nice, the valet parking convenient and reasonable, and the food was excellent.We enjoyed the seating in proximity to the kitchen and were able to watch from a distance given the open kitchen concept.  In fact, to walk in or out of the restaurant one actually walks through a portion of the kitchen.  We were seated at a table for 4 and had plenty of room.  Noise was average, a bit more due to the kitchen but not excessive.  The lunch menu for Restaurant Week was very extensive, in fact we were surprised.  My wife had scallops as a starter, followed by grilled tuna.  I had a house smoked Columbia River Sturgeon Rillette, followed by wood oven roasted confit of Duck Leg.  We shared an apple pie for two (and took half home).  With a glass of prosecco to start and a very nice Pinot Noir with the main, it was excellent!We will come back, our experience with lunch was very pleasant.  Everyone was friendly and service was very good.",Dennis R.
1930,Brooklyn,2009-03-10,XVfmxovyA63LiPF9ZqysHQ,5, NY,"The simply-named farm-to-table dishes available at this, one of DC's culinary holy-places are nothing short of perfect.At its heart, Blue Duck Tavern does what it claims to do:  weave simple, fresh ingredients into well crafted food. Where this establishment far exceeds that claim:  These simple, fresh ingredients are brought to bear in their finest forms and manipulated into exceptionally crafted dishes with deep, complex, and most importantly, absolutely exquisite flavors and textures.The experience began with walking through two massive double-doors into a well-appointed, modern space, abutting what appeared to be a bread and pastry kitchen.  Next to that, large, oblong bowls of various vegetables and spices were laid out on huge rectangular wooden slabs, placed at various heights.  Clean lines and modern wooden furniture criss-cross the floor of the high-ceilinged dining room, complete with a muted light-level and otherwise warm atmosphere, ideal for quiet conversation.  We were led to a table in one of the rear corners of the restaurant.  Despite being placed directly next to another table of diners, I never felt that our privacy was being infringed upon.  That, in my opinion, is one of the most vital elements that goes into making a well-designed dining area.  I started with the House Smoked Sturgeon Rillette with Caviar Jelly.  Rillettes are most often meat spreads, made classically from pork or game meats and are usually not unlike paté.  This rillette featured a top layer of a sort of sturgeon mousse (rather than the cooking fat that floats to the top of the meat versions), under which was what might be described as a smoked sturgeon salad -- small chunks of sturgeon, mixed with a white aioli-like sauce.  The dish was topped with a generous scoop of the ""caviar jelly"", which had a strong but not bitterly-salty flavor (my lovely date pointed out that cheaper caviars tend to be more on the bitter side of the spectrum).  This mixture was served with garlic toast-points.  The smokiness of the mousse/fish and the salt-driven punch of the caviar jelly combine with the crunchy, seasoned toast into an explosive flavor combination.  I have never tasted anything quite like it before and as such, don't have much to which I can compare it.  It was positively packed with flavor and (I'll say it again) perfect .The entree that followed constitutes the finest preparation of pork I've had.  I went with the Black Berkshire Rack with Roasted Apples.  This is not your friendly neighborhood, run-of-the-mill pork.  It was tender, exceptionally moist and carried a subtle, sweet flavor along with the hearty taste of the meat.  The apples served as a slightly crunchy, sweet accompaniment that lent the dish an extra layer of taste and texture when combined with bites of the meat.  I also need to mention that I was able to use a butter knife to cut these expertly-prepared chops.  Along with our entrees, we split an order of the Mustard Spaetzle ""Mac and Cheese"" with Duck Confit.  It was served in an oval baking-dish with roasted panko breakcrumbs adorning the top and woven through with rich strands of duck meat.  This is how a side dish should be.  It was rich, flavorful and in a portion large enough to easily serve two.For dessert, we tried the apple pie, also big enough for two (and one of the waiters serving our table added the home-made vanilla ice-cream for free!)  The browned, spicy crust and large, warm chunks of glazed apples with cinnamon were quite good.  The rich vanilla ice cream served very well to cut the spiciness of the cinammon and to cleanse our tired palates.The service was impeccable.  The waitstaff kept our waters filled and appeared on-cue to clear spent plates and offer us refills for our wine.  They also helped us choose some of our dishes, and explained the contents and preparation of any dishes about which we were unclear.Blue Duck Tavern is--without a doubt--one of my favorite dining experiences of all time.  They've opened my eyes to some innovative preparations of otherwise uncomplicated ingredients and put their best foot forward in the decor and service categories.",Jonathan S.
1931,La Plata,2013-01-09,l9vqjcPDj6_W_SWj7K0v-Q,4, MD,Ate dinner here Christmas Day.  Enjoyed a couple cocktails with my wife in the bar area which has a great atmosphere.  My Old Fashioned was excellent.  Service was great during dinner.  I had raw oysters which were fresh and my wife enjoyed their mushroom tart.  She is still talking about it weeks later.  For dinner I had 12 hour roasted pig and it was fantastic.  The side of brussel sprouts and cranberries we ordered was a great compliment to the dish.  My wife had a charcuterie board and enjoyed it very much.  Apricot sorbet for dessert was a great refresher at the end of the meal.  Looking forward to going back.,Chuck C.

Anyway, BDT was a smash hit, I would say. We got a ton of food to go around the table, plus desserts and so on.

1934,Washington,2009-06-06,cwM8Kr2fTl9O66yhjQ6iRw,5, DC,"can't wait to go back. this is what great food should be: simple and high quality. I went to Blue Duck Tavern a couple of weeks ago for the first time after a couple of friends told me how great it was, and I have to say it exceeded my expectations. as others have pointed out the service is excellent (the waiters that helped us were actually really helpful while not being pretentious but instead really nice) and the portions are quite big (trying to finish starter, main course and desert is actually not easy). others didn't like the decor, i actually really liked it, very functional and simple ... in a way like the food ... but without becoming bland and boring. i had a broccoli soup as a starter (i usually don't order soups but this one sounded good) and it was a real treat. usually i find soups a bit too watery or they are just too creamy with no actual taste of what is supposed to be in it. but this one was spot on, not too watery and lots of broccoli bites in it. for the main course i had the chicken baked in a salt crust which was just outstanding. we ordered some greens with this but the chicken meat was the star of the course, tender and juicy ... i think i haven't had a better chicken yet at a restaurant. what i found amazing at blue duck is that the way the different courses and dishes are prepared you can opt in for a couple of sides (the meat will not come with it) but since the dishes are so well prepared they don't need anything else, they are their own full dish. for desert we had the apple tart with some red tea. initially we thought that both were a bit over-priced, but we ordered on tea and one cake and the waiter brought us two cups and two plates and the tea ended up being four cups in total and the cake could have easily fed four. not to mention that both were excellent. in addition to the cake the waiter also brought us some vanilla ice cream for free since we didn't order it but he thought it was important to have with the cake. i think this was the first time in my life that i actually took a doggy bag home from a restaurant ... and that was because we could barely finish half of the apple tart and they packed it up for us. i will certainly be back to this place. if you love excellent but simple food this is the place for you.",Carsten S.
1935,Arlington,2009-04-28,As4WV4-iZOCV9TF5781dYA,3, VA,"4 stars for dinner, but only 2 for the attached Tea Cellar = 3 star review.Dinner here was wonderful - everything was fresh and flavorful, service was attentive without hovering, and omg the desserts!  I love the spare design of the dining room, and the open kitchen with the enormous French cooking range is drool-worthy for a 'kitchen geek' like me.  Those little apple pies lined up on the counter - ! - so good.  I will also never forget the asparagus appetizer with a bacon vinaigrette and poached quail egg...amazing.  Love the little pans/pots of entrees and side dishes for sharing.  The food here is upscale but accessible (i.e. you could bring a non-adventurous diner here and they wouldn't freak out), and they are firmly on the local/sustainable wagon - I think this was one of the first DC restaurants to list the source locations of all major ingredients (e.g. Polyface Farms, etc.).HOWEVER, the Tea Cellar is totally a different story.  I don't really like to Yelp about issues that I've *resolved* with management, but let this serve as a cautionary tale: don't plan on bringing a group of more than 8 to tea here.  I made plans to host a bridal shower (party of 20) in the Tea Cellar space, went over to the Hyatt in person several times to discuss/confirm how the space would be arranged and the tea served (it's sold by the pot), and on the day of the party, the staff and space was still completely unprepared.  And the 'tea experts' pouring the pots of various teas had no idea what they were talking about, describing two clearly different varieties as the same tea.  When I wrote to Hyatt management detailing my dismay at how poorly the party was handled considering the cost of the event, they offered me a complimentary tea for myself + guests.  I brought my mom and baby sister, who had a wonderful time with all the desserts (they even brought out ice cream for my sister), and this time the tea server was chatty and seemed to know her stuff - so, experience partially redeemed, albeit at the high cost of the original tea party.  I just wouldn't ever bring a group back.  Also, note that it's just a dessert tea - not afternoon tea with savories and sandwiches.",K S.

1937,Washington,2009-02-19,JPkHVHQC-0OokvcieedvJg,5, DC,"I can always count on Blue Duck Tavern to make a night special. The two times I came here were for special occasions... and EACH time our party of 2 did not leave disappointed!!The format of this restaurant reminds me a lot of Craft Los Angeles. Family-style presentation and a la carte menus. But my experience has been better at the Blue Duck Tavern (but it's important to note I've only been to Craft once).  The standouts of the night is definitely the Rack of Black Berkshire coupled with a sweet Grilled Peach or Apple - depending on season.  Perfectly prepared, succulent and juicy - this dish is perfection (my staple dish) and tempts me to eat both cuts although the practical side of me stops me short of being too stuffed for dessert. My friend's braised rib was also perfectly cooked and falling off the bone, which was the only thing left when he was done with it.  The sides shine as brightly as the mains...the Heirloom Grits with the blue cheese - Creamy, divine - something I've definitely not had before elsewhere. Roast mixed mushrooms - which were cooked to perfection but not to heavily buttered. Sweet Pumpkin mash with goat cheese was also creamy and delicious... although given its simiilar texture to the grits - I wished I had ordered the brussel sprouts instead...  In spite of the hefty portions - I ALWAYS leave room for dessert (I have quite the sweet tooth).  The Poached Pear and Fresh Blueberries, Almond Crumble, Mascarpone Cream was just perfectly light and simple, while the Warm Apple pie with their Delicious Vanilla Ice cream was a scene stealer. They make their ice cream in house here and it is NOT to be missed if you're a sweet tooth. Given the hefty pricetag on the dinner, it pains me to know that I have to reserve my visits to special occasions, but it always leaves me looking forward to the next birthday dinner or celebration.",Sharon C.

The Duck Confit Mac & Cheese is off the chain yo!!! Loved it. This is pure enjoyable comfort food. I've always detested Marshmellow's and Yams for holiday foods, but their Gingerbread Yams is a masterful upgrade from such a horrible whitetrash concoction. The Grits with blue cheese is another fantastic creation. Now the garlic mash was a too much on the soupy side my taste.

1943,Gaithersburg,2008-12-15,FLrW7TQ8lRz71vDWDvY_YQ,5, MD,"My parents are very traditional Chinese.  They really only appreciate Chinese food, finding western flavoring bland, and the use of ingredients boring.  Knowing this, my brother (foodie extraordinaire) and I arranged a dinner with them at Blue Duck Tavern.  They gave their unequivocal two (four?) thumbs up!We were able to get a table with a view of the open kitchen.  While this was amusing and gave us something to talk about (other then my unwillingness to bear them many many grandbabies, or my brother's state of unwedded bliss), I'm ""eh"" on the whole concept - I like my food to magically appear before me, I don't find watching the drudgery of my food being prepared as especially tillitating or interesting.  The dining room was sparse and serene, and the view of the ""wine cellar"" gave Blue Duck their first thumbs up from my father (raging alcoholics that we are).For appetizer, we had the grilled bone marrow, which was succulent and delicious (but be sure to add some of the sea salt that it is served with - our server didn't explain, and it makes a world of difference), the fois gras creme brulee (which is not very PC, but who says ""no"" to fois gras?) which was a little too sweet for me but my brother enjoyed greatly, and the perfectly fried pork belly, which I will marry as soon as Congress passes a law which will allow me to marry my food.  All in all, the appetizers were a great open for the meal - and although I enjoyed my entree hugely, I could have been quite happy just dining on the appetizers alone!For our entrees, my dad ordered the lamb, which was thick and perfectly medium-rare and seasoned with such a careful hand, that he neither needed soy sauce nor hot chili oil to enjoy his dish (and yes, my father will ask for soy sauce - or more accurately, make ME ask for it).  My mom had the whole rainbow trout - which seemed to be more of a bass then a trout - but still flaky and moist.  My parents did note that the fish was cooked a little longer then they normally like their fish, but I think this is more of an Asian thing, then a problem with Blue Duck's cooking methods.  I've noticed that Americans tend to like all of their foods more well-done then Asians.  Yes, my parents know this of western cooking, but I refused to ask the waiter to undercook the fish (I could just see the chef spit into our fish with a request like that), so I did get one or two baleful glares from my dad for this dish's misstep.  I had the cod cheeks which were so flavorful that I could have happily bathed in the sauce like Elizabeth Bathoy, and my brother had the beef short-ribs which were falling off the bone perfect.  We were beyond stuffed by the time we were done with our entrees, yet...yet we ordered dessert.  The fruit compote was tasty but nothing spectacular, however the chocolate cake with the vanilla ice cream was practically a review in itself.  I normally don't like chocolate cake (yes, I'm female, and no, I don't crave chocolate cake...chocolate martinis are a different story) because it's usually too sweet and rich and heavy.  However, this chocolate cake was moist and rich without being heavy.  It was a touch sweeter then I liked, especially paired with the homemade vanilla ice-cream, however, the flavors combined so well together, that for once, I understood the allure of chocolate cake a la mode.Our server was quite excellent, despite not explaining how to eat the bone marrow dish.  He was cheerful without being annoying, and checked up on us just often enough to make sure that we had a steady flow of wine and water, without being cloying and irritating.  Very wisely he waited until after we were finished with our entrees before having a short conversation with us about our meal (I hate it when the wait staff tries to make conversation while I'm greedily inhaling my food).  Full and mellow from the marvelous meal, we allowed him to talk us into ordering more dessert then we could possibly eat.  Although, we did finish everything, so perhaps he could see that our bellies were indeed bigger then our eyes.",Fenny L.

This review will only be based on what little I can recall. I did a site visit here for work when they first reopened and I really do love the decor of the hotel and am glad that the same decor flows into the restaurant. Those HUGE entrance doors are fabulous! The bar area is also BEAUTIFUL with all the glass enclosures. We really should've just stayed and enjoyed our meal here instead of the main dining area. The servers here were SO gracious and obliging. I can still remember that our 2 glasses of champagne were filled nearly to the brim. Very generous!Our experience in the dining room was just ""good."" The server did everything he was supposed to, but nothing above and beyond. I was REALLY impressed with how immaculately CLEAN everything in the open part of the kitchen was (I can be a bit Monica-esque about cleanliness and organization at times). Food was fair, although I don't remember much. I know that the bf really enjoyed the THICK fries and really enjoyed that they served them with ketchup despite the settings. It was cute that they were served in this tiny copper pot, all standing up.  I read such great things about the grits so I was disappointed when eating them. I think I'm just going to stop ordering grits at restaurants because I'm consistently disappointed by them (here, Vidalia, lots of other places). I wish I hadn't been so sloshed (too much wine! I was celebrating! 4 years!) because I don't think I/we were very good judges of the food as a result of it.  I'm definitely going to have to come back to retry the food. By judging everyone else's reviews...there's definitely something we missed out on. I don't know if this a typical freebie they give you (like the cotton candy they do/did at 2941) but at the end of the meal they gave us a nice take-home bag of rugelach with a Happy Anniversary note attached! It was a nice touch.",Joan K.

1954,Washington,2014-06-04,mQ8UZsMmZ9l51yHvSX-Zqw,3, DC,"I have been to Blue Duck Tavern before for dinner, which was great.  Last Sunday, I went for brunch.  The food was delicious and the selections are different than the average brunch menu.  They have lovely outdoor seating under umbrellas.  Our service was really the poorest service I have experienced in a long time. Our waitresss was Adrienne D.  She took about 45 minutes to come over to our table to take an order.  After being seated and waiting about a half hour without being acknowledged, I had to go out of my way to ask for the wine list and order my first drink from another person (not even a waiter) and asked him to send my waiter or waitress. She never came, so he brought my first drink.  Finally she sauntered over about 20 minutes after my drink was served.  When we did finally place our food orders, she forgot to bring my friend's iced tea.  She never came around after the food arrived so that we could reorder.  She was literally the disappearing/nonexistent waitress.  She did come by about an hour later to acknowledge she forgot the iced tea, but at that point my friend simply canceled.  I had to go seek her out in the restaurant to get our check.  Blue Duck Tavern has great food, but I really expected better service for a restaurant of this caliber.  I do not think the other waiters (at least not from what I observed and from past experience) are like Adrienne D, but a bad waitress can really ruin the entire meal.",L R.

I was fortunate enough to be treated to a dinner at the chef's table here and it was easily one of the best meals I have ever had. From the roast pork, to the grilled radicchio, to the rabbit sausage to the swordfish, everything I tasted was divine. The dessert, a pear cobbler, chocolate torte and assorted ice creams, was impeccable as well...and I'm not a huge fan of dessert.

The veal cheeks stand out, excellent.  Tender and full of flavor.  The bone marrow was good but too much bread and the presentation was awkward.  It seems like you were meant to spread it on the bread, but someone who would even order bone marrow eats it straight, so the bread altough good, was a waste.  The veal shins main course was good but slightly underseasoned.  Same with the crabcake.  The desserts were the chocolate cake and the bannana cream pie, both mediocre.  Tonight was a bit of a miss, when held to such high standards.  Still this is one of my top choices in the city.  We will return.  He needs a tasting menu.",A C.

Each of us had a bowl of the french onion soup (an elaborate version with the usual bread and cheese topping along with a puffy soufflé baked on top) and shared the sturgeon appetizer along with a cafe au lait.

Which reminded me to write a review.)The service was great. Our waiter who resembled John Malkovich, was well versed with the menu. I ordered the scallops. Which I really enjoyed. They were well seasoned & tender. I recommend the scallops, you will not be disappointed.  The portion size is more than enough. My girlfriend had the strip loin of beef medium rare. The loin's temperature was perfectly cooked. I also enjoyed this entree. After reading the reviews here about the roasted bone marrow. I had to order it and it was delicious. I just would have loved to have one more bone (greedy). The sides (polenta, warm pie of sheeps' milk) we ordered were solid. Our waiter also added in an additional side on him (kudos) of cucumber in yogurt & dill; which was good. The setting was very relaxing. Our table was located right in front of the open kitchen.

1962,Los Angeles,2008-10-13,2ra7vm9pb63XtE47Jhi33A,3, CA,"Blue Duck was a nice restaurant, however I must say that I was disappointed. I must be spoiled since I am from the San Francisco Bay area (restaurant mecca), but the ratings in both zagat and yelp seem inflated.I was told the place was romantic, however it really depends on where they choose to seat you. From where we were seated, there was no fireplace in sight and the open kitchen was obstructed by a divider in the center of the room. The different seating areas are odd... it's like multiple restaurants in one large area. And, on top of that, the service was inattentive and cold. The food was also hit or miss. The crabcake, which was recommended by the waiter, was EXTREMELY fishy. I cringe thinking about it. My boyfriend's steak (the most expensive item on the menu if I recall) was probably the worst thing we ate there. The texture was off, the meat quality wasn't good, and their cooking method was suspect. Onto the highlights: The spatzle ""mac and cheese"" was delicious and indulgent, the lamb shank was well-cooked, the mashed potatoes were very creamy, and the fries were unique and enjoyable. The concept behind the meal is interesting: a la carte, sharable portions for every menu item. It kind of reminds me of Thomas Keller's Ad Hoc in Yountville, CA... except that is about 30 times better. Overall, it is a decent dining experience if you order the right thing, get seated in the right areas, and go there on a good night.",Amanda C.

The hostess was friendly and helpful and the wait staff were efficient.  The food although good, was not great.  They receive more points for presentation than taste. We had the bone marrow for an appetizer which made a great presentation, but not worth the fuss for the little taste of marrow you get. We had the tavern steak which was perfectly done, and for sides we had the chard also excellent but on the sweet side, the fries that were OK, (I don't understand what all the fuss about the fries is about) , and the polenta different from any polenta I have had in the past as this was soupy and runny.  I don't know if the polenta I have had elsewhere was prepared correctly or not.  The choices of sides were heavy on the carbs, not much green to choose from.  I would have liked to order the pheasant, but it was for two and none of my dining companions were willing to go for it.  Dessert was fun, we had the apple pie which was good but not as good as a scratch made homemade pie, the ice cream also good, the burbon chocolate flaming cake had a fun presentation, but tasted like warm brownie batter, and the peach blueberry crumble  was forgetable. The coffee was excellent as was the tap water.  I will return with a dining companion that is willing to go for the pheasant.",Michael D.

But the execution leaves something to be desired. Examples? The fries are soggy and bland. The butter lettuce salad is ordinary at best. The burger is not even close to worth the money. No exaggeration, almost EVERYTHING needs seasoning (which is interesting, considering the tables do not have salt and pepper shakers). I always feel like the food has so much potential but can't quite live up to it.The service is attentive to the point of annoying, including the constant not-so-subtle upsell. But when you actually need something, the staff is MIA! On my last visit, I got halfway through my steak (literally) before I was offered a steak knife, albeit with profuse apologies. The busboy graciously topped off our water glasses -- with tap water, not the sparkling water we already had in them. The sommelier even spilled wine on the table when he was pouring.I want to like Blue Duck, but I just can't. I expect better than this.",C E.

Overall, a very enjoyable experience.   However, I will say that the first type I came here, I had some sort of vegetable casserole that was just heavenly.  The entrees this time around were very good but not divine, which is why I'm taking off 1/2 star.",Thaila S.

My experience with the service at the Blue Duck Tavern was excellent, and the restaurant is beautiful. My friend and I commented that it would be a great date spot, and that the outdoor seating would be extra-romantic (as long as you're not in the throes of August's heat and humidity).We started with the:1. bone marrow. This being my first marrow experience, I'm not sure whether it was amazing or not -- I got the heebie geebies with the gelatinous texture (I know, ""Priss!""), but the flavor was great and it came with roasted garlic cloves and fresh rosemary. We then shared the:2. crab cakes (delish, full of lump crab meat with little filler, and a great remoulade sauce)3. braised rib (meat falling off the bone and with a rich flavorful sauce -- this was my favorite food of the evening)4. pickled tomatoes (ok but didn't knock my socks off - I've had much more flavorful tomatoes)5. grits with goat cheese (oh so creamy - wonderful)And we ended with the:6. Apple pie a la mode. Award-winning, so perhaps my expectations were too high? I admit it was pretty great -- an individually-sized pie, meaning you get extra crust (and it's GOOD crust), and the 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream served in its separate bucket were lovely... but I always prefer a bit of tartness to my apple pie (I use granny smith apples when baking at home), and these apples were in fabulous big chunks but were sweet and not tart. Therein lies my disappointment. If you like sweet apple pie, you'll be in heaven.Overall, it was a great experience. But nothing jumped out at me from the menu, and the prices seemed a tad steep.

As a bit of an aside, the couple dining next to us ordered the ""Angry Trout,""  It did indeed look angry and I would too, if my tail were puled through my mouth.  It was quite the show piece and we all gawked at it.  The guy who ordered it seemed to enjoy the angry little guy quite a bit.  It was quite amazing looking.Now for dessert!  Ahhhh dessert!  My favorite part of any meal and this wasn't just any meal it was my Birthday.  (Thank god Man-friend did not tell them that it was my birthday.  I hate that.)  So, we ordered the ""Made to order Chocolate Cake with Bourbon.""  It comes to your table in a flaming ball of wonderment (our Angry Trout friends were quite impressed).  I totally was not expecting it to be on fire and surprisingly it burned for quite some time.  We also had the hazelnut coffee ice cream .  It came in a frozen ice bucket with a wooden spoon to serve with.  (It made me feel a little better about my presentation at our dinner parties and it was cute.)  I had a Latte- excellent.  Man-friend had a Knob Creek on the rocks (who's Birthday was it?) and that bartender has quite a heavy hand.  Thanks bartender!  So, back to the sweets, it was great!  The bourbon helped to give a nice dimension to the intense chocolate of the cake.  We both agreed that we would have it again.  The food was really great.  The service was excellent (our server was a fantastically witty man named Mike- I loved him.) Plus, it was very reasonable for locally sourced fancy-pants food.  All in all a fantastic birthday!",Suzzanne L.

1977,Washington,2008-12-18,MMkKI_p4vQ1yp9qidmxOqQ,3, DC,"I am going to echo a review from below: 3 1/2 stars, with the potential to easily hit 4 or 4.5.I took my beau to BDT for his birthday and our meal was wildly up and down.  Our table had a good view of the open kitchen (I highly recommend asking for a view); our waiter greeted us promptly; and our cocktails (a pear and elderflower martini) were perfectly balanced and more than adequately strong.  The ambiance is soft and presents a nice balance of modernity and country, with handsome touches of marble, chrome, light woods, and glass.  Good start.Then the trouble began.  It took us a while to figure out what we wanted, and though everything the waiter said was in theory correct (""take your time,"" etc.) his tone became increasing impatient and humorless.  To boot, our appetizers were significantly delayed; they took at least 20 minutes longer than they should have.  The upside: even though we did not complain, the manager was profusely apologetic, and told us our meal would be accompanied by extras courtesy of the chef.  The downside: unfortunately, after three pieces of bread each, the notion of extra food wasn't that appealing.  The wait was worth it, though: the scallops.  Kissed by a light anise sauce and nicely joined with some thinly shaved fennel, giving it just the right amount of textural variety, they tasted of clean, crisp, winter's ocean.  Probably the best I've ever had, and the saving grace of the meal.  Our second appetizer would have made more sense as a side starch -- the ""mac and cheese"" spaetzle, which, with its heavy cream, fatty duck confit, and cheese was far too rich and heavy to be contemplated alone.  Delicious, yes, but two bites worth is more than enough  Save it for your entrees, and share it with at least two people.  The restaurant also gave us a complementary plate of perfect prociutto -- razor thin, soft -- an incongruous addition, but a delicious one nonetheless. The see-saw ride continued: entrees, unlike the apps, arrived immediately, giving us literally no time to digest and reset.  Atfer three appetizers, we could have used it. The braised beef was perfectly cooked, served literally falling off the bone -- really the epitome of a wonderful, savory winter dish.  The crabcakes were as fresh as I've tasted, but otherwise unexceptional. They broke apart at the touch of a fork and were served with easily two tablespoons of tartar sauce -- so much that you could not avoid slathering the cakes.  A restaurant of this caliber can do more.  Our two sides reflected the rest of the topsy-turvey experience: one, the pumpkin gratin, was creamy,  subtly spiced, and smartly topped with toasted pumkin seeds.  The other, however, BDT french fries, were overcooked, so much so that some of them were actually leathery!  French fries are too easy not to get right.  Along with a second round of sincere apologies, the chef also sent us a third (!) entree of sausages atop stewed red cabbage.  They were smokey and the cabbage was nicely bittersweet and cooked to an excellent consistency; but, again, the dish was incongruous especially because it was so heavy.  Unfortunately, all of the food left us overfull and (despite opting for a big doggie bag rather than trying to tackle all of the food), we did not have room for desserts -- which was unfrotunate, because they looked fabulous.  The parting touch was emblematic of BDT's strengths: while we were waiting for our coats, the hostess saw us eyeing the cookies for sale by the entrance to the restaurant.  She remembered that it was my beau's birthday, and insisted that he choose a bag of his choice.  (Hours later, we tried one, and it was superb.)My advice echoes Ina, below: If you're going with a party of two, get an appetizer, decide on one entree, and get three sides.  My advice to the restaurant: when you run into significant timing issues, it makes more sense to comp the appetizers (or course) than to throw more food at the customer -- especially a party of two.  Almost 24 hours later I am still full, and one shouldn't leave a restaurant feeling like they are going to burst.Like the choreographed presentation of the many small platters at your table, the decor and the service (some quasi-sniffy waitstaff aside) are first-class at Blue Duck Tavern.  Some minor fixes, and perhaps a slightly lighter touch with the cream, and it truly would be one of DC's best.",Daniel P.
1978,New York,2011-02-22,aorh7nvNUGBJNECOrKOmkg,5, NY,"OMG! This place was fabulously delicious.  We came here for brunch after seeing it featured on the Cooking Channel, Unique Eats, we just had to try it out (mind you, we are from NYC).  We took a drive and it did not dissapoint! My donut brioche french toast was scrumptious, soaked in I dunno what, but tasted like condensed milk and butter? topped with various types of nuts, I think I tasted some coconut bits... it was sooo goood! but very sweet.. the BDT fries were like fries from heaven, with a lil hint of salt and parsely (maybe)? it was triple fried in duck fat, apparently.  My other half got the ricotta pancake with poppy seed and lemon zest honey on the side, it was like the perfect combination of cakey sweetness and poppy crunch.  We also got the beets, omgg!! to sooo good, it was vinegar-y, beet sweetness, and citrus zest and almond, again all the right combo and just enough taste to wow you!! WE got the home made croissants, it came with 4 different spreads, honey, apricot, ricotta, and some other sweet spread.  I thought it was just alright, I've had better croissants, and hoped it would be more fluffy on the inside, but it was too airy and empty for my taste, umm, 4 croissants for $12 and so so tasting? I guess you could pass.  My coffee was $5, good for 4 refills, and my husband's fresh squeezed OJ was also $5, and the waiter kept refilling his glass, up to 4 times as well, and he was happy with that.  Its pretty rare to get free refills of fresh squeezed OJ at most restaurants.  The drive to eat here was worthwhile - the restaurant was classy but not stiff like some places in NYC, you have the freedom to wear jeans and flip flops and still get in, of course with a reservation - you didn't need to have to wear a jacket in order to be seated like Bouley in nyc for example.  They have little wooden stools for ladies' handbags that would sit right beside your feet while you're dining.  It was cute!",Ann C.

The host and hostess were very accommodating and very pleasant to deal with.

Our professional server, Mike, was wonderful and a master of his craft. The marrow and sweetbreads were to die for! Prices are on-par for the superb menu items and service that you will receive.

1982,Boston,2008-04-29,U7h2th3XSB8ftxgu05QrBg,1, MA,"I just had lunch there with 4 colleagues, and the one star is based on previous visits as well. We decided to give this place another try, since the last time we were there it was happy hour and maybe it was simply an off night - 20 minutes to get a drink? Ok, another chance.Last chance.The host told us they had no tables in the restaurant area but could accommodate us in the bar area, which was fine - we ended up in a cool glass box that was private. But the restaurant tables that I could see in the distance were never filled, not during our 90 minute lunch, 80 of which were spent waiting. And waiting. And waiting. We ordered two orders of french fries (they are delicious - served in these awesome little pots w/tongs). One showed after 45 minutes. One serving works out to about 6 thick-cut, seasoned fries. We reminded our server that we ordered two, she apologized and said it was her fault, and put a second order in for us. Fifteen minutes later, our second order of fries showed, along with 4 of the 5 entrees we ordered. We sat and waited for the fifth meal to come, and it took 6 minutes. Six minutes is 5 and 1/2 too long, especially when the price is about $22/entree, and it's Tuesday, and we have to get back to work. I understand that gourmet means expensive, but it should also mean excellent service. The quality of the food was good, but the experience - during a Tuesday at lunch - was terrible. And it's happened to us before, so one can only assume it will happen again. The restaurant is beautiful, sure, and the food was pretty good, but the service  was abysmal enough to warrant one star.",Lori M.
1983,Rochester Hills,2008-10-23,W0KavXOlx4W2XH2ZzksYjQ,4, MI,"If the restaurant owners actually cared about this review, they couldn't be happier with the night I was there. It was an absolutely beautiful spring evening which allowed us to have dinner seated outside at Blue Duck. Blue Duck features one of the more interesting menus that I've seen. You have appreciate the freshness that comes with the seasonal ingredients they feature, but I'm a little gunshy about a few items offered (e.g. ""hot pigs trotter""). And I definitely was thankful for the plate of freshly sliced prosciutto that was given to us shortly after our basket of bread. I'm not normally one to indulge in the seafood selections when I have other options, but I figured when I'm that close to Maryland I would do myself a disservice by not getting the Jumbo Lump Crabcakes. The crab cake entree was two substantially-sized crab cakes with plenty of crab meat in each. They were very good, but I must admit that they were nothing compared to the Wood Fired Diver Maine Scallops, which were easily the best scallops I've ever eaten. Consider that I've already stated I don't eat much seafood, but I love scallops. For sides we went potato times two. The Roasted Fingerlings with bacon and onion were maybe a little under seasoned, but nothing that couldn't be addressed table-side. Or maybe they were very good but overshadowed by the Hand Cut BDT Triple Fries which were delicious, though I did wonder what might be a fun dipping sauce for them. When you walk into Blue Duck, you are conveniently herded past the station where their popular apple pies are prepared. They recommend one to share, and it is plenty big enough for two people. ""Would you like vanilla ice cream with that?"" Of course I would. A small, nearly-personal pie with a delicious caramelized brown sugar top served with three big scoops of vanilla ice cream. I guess I should mention the bottle of 2005 Montes ""Alpha"" Cabernet Sauvignon from Chile that we had. It, as well as everything served, knocked my socks off.",Peter S.
1984,San Francisco,2007-08-15,N3M0SX3mDy3nqa6MeMuoXQ,4, CA,"Dined here last night for the first time.  Friend is moving to Tanzania of all places with an NGO for a year, so this was her last ""good"" meal for a while.  The decor is modern with classic lines.  Lots of polished beige stone with mahogany colored wood, high ceilings, awesome bar area up front.  The furniture is Shaker-style, which is very sparse and spindly looking.  I wouldn't have guessed it, but it works out pretty well visually.  This place is about FOOD.  Really substantial, wholesome, straightforward preparations.  When you eat meat, they make it very clear that you're eating meat.  And same with fish, vegetables, etc.  In fact, BDT lists the farm where it sources the primary ingredient for each dish.  A little gimmicky, but an appreciated effort.  Since this was a ""last supper"" of sorts we took the gloves off with the ordering.  Appetizers4 each of Cape May Salts, Hog Island, and Rocky Bay Oysters: Fresh oysters, not much more to it.  Carpaccio of Young Farm Lamb, Summer Beans, Artichoke, and Olives: The lamb was delicious and cut razor thin, but it was difficult to eat since all the slices stuck together.  The summer beans were great, but the artichokes were sized 4-5 times anything else in this dish.  Warm Fois Gras, Bourbon Peach Consomme, Gingerbread: Very delicious, perfectly cooked.  Oven Roasted Bone Marrow, Roast Garlic Bulb, Grilled Sourdough: Our favorite appetizer.  Three hulking bones, split along the bone as opposed to cut across the bone, a huge roasted bulb of garlic, and grilled sourdough.  A decadent version of garlic bread - the garlic was so good we ended up popping the remaining cloves on their own.  EntreesBraised Barbecue Beef 'Long Rib': Due to the size of beef ribs in general, this entree hit the table and elicited an ""ooh"" and an ""ahh.""  It's so massive you feel as if you're sitting down to eat a mastadon.  The meat was braised perfectly - no knife needed here.  And the suace wasn't a straightforward barbecue sauce - there was a bit more sweetness to it and a little less tang - I wonder if there was some hoisin in it.  Wood Fired Whole Sea Bream, Bay Leaf and Thyme: I'm generally a huge fan of whole fish and my companion didn't object to thought of dismantling a fish at the table, so we ordered this and were not disappointed.  It was stuffed with bay and time, and just simply roasted with salt and pepper, topped with some lemon.  Whole Roasted Maine Lobster, Lobster Drawn Butter: The lobster was just totally unnecessary, but whatever... nothing exceeds like excess.  Besides, if you were going to Tanzania for a year, wouldn't you want to have this too?  There wasn't anything particularly spectacular about this - it was excellent in the way all well-prepared lobster is excellent.  I did appreciate that it was roasted instead of steamed or boiled - that did add a little more depth to the flavors. SidesClothbound Cheddar Puffs: Light airy pastries with a cheddar note.  The cheddar is definitley present, but it's as much an olfactory note as it is taste.  Meaning, you smelled and tasted the cheddar, but didn't catch the sharpness on your tongue.  Which for a side, I suppose, is appropriate. Dessert/CheeseSugar Cookies: Got a tin of these to go.  Not bad. Selection of Cheeses: Had two cheeses.  One was the McCadem Extra Sharp Cheddar, which one the 2007 US Championship Cheese Contest.  As expected it was very good.  The other cheese was a sheep's cheese that bordered on Manchego.Wine:McMurray 2005 Russian River Pinot Gris: 7/10Chehalem 2005 3 Vineyards Pinot Noir: 8/10DP",David P.

Our mushroom side hadn't arrived by the time we finished our main courses, though we did ask.  The waiter brought it after with an apology and a promise to take it off the menu.  The manager did come by at the end and say he heard we had had slow service (which I was impressed by because we had not complained) and I think comp'd some of our drinks, which was a nice gesture, but frankly for a $600 meal I would just as soon have had it be right in the first place.",Alison S.

1993,Washington,2010-02-08,h_HXOChKr_RZgruVjOrjpA,3, DC,"Caveat: I went here on Sunday night during the recent blizzard, so the place was nearly empty and the service not quite operating at well-oiled machine levels.The space/ambience is sort of weird. Walking through the space I was struck by its restrained loveliness in places, but from the vantage point of our table, near the windows onto 24th street, I felt a lot like we were sitting in an extension of the hotel lobby, replete with piped in muzak. I mean, that's what it is, after all, but its not ideal for classy dinner. So maybe see if you can get an internal table. Food: Started with the bone marrow appetizer, which is justly praised. Not that I had everything on the menu, but still, if you go to this restaurant GET THE MARROW. It's a really unique and decadent taste and BDT's preparation complements it in beautiful ways. Girlfriend had their winter salad, which she liked fine.For entrees we had the beef rib and the duck breast. The duck breast, as has been noted elsewhere, is cooked very rare and comes out kinda lukewarm. It was fine (and in a delicious sauce), but far from my top tier duck experiences. Note, however, that the duck breast comes with this knockout, ridiculously smoky andouille sausage. The beef rib is melt in your mouth style as noted elsewhere and is served with another great sauce, all of which screams beef. More successful than the duck, but it is what it is and no more.Sides were a solidly tasty glazed carrots dish and this polenta with wild mushrooms that was kind of annoying, as any legitimate interesting mushroom taste was consumed by boring polenta taste. Dessert was the apple pie thing and their homemade vanilla ice cream. Not sure what I was expecting, but there are very few ways to make apple pie non-pedestrian, and they have not found one of them.Total for two appetizers, two cocktails, two entrees, two sides, two desserts, and a bottle of wine, including tip, was $260.Was it worth it? Yes, but yes for DC, if you know what I mean: everything very professional, some definite standouts, but some things phoned in, too.",Alex B.

2001,San Francisco,2008-04-05,Z5MWQGFpHGJurcNBjmH0RQ,5, CA,"My husband and I went to Blue Duck Tavern for a leisurely, long lunch on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. I never really go to this section of DC because it's hidden away btw Foggy Bottom and Dupont and really, when am I ever going to go to these luxury hotels anyway. We like to try out some of these nicer restaurants during lunch time, if they are open then, so that we don't necessarily break out bank trying some good food. The service was impeccable, and we really loved the carpaccio with quail egg delicately dropped on top, with arugula salad simply seasoned in oil, salt, and pepper. I got the bass and he got the steak, both of which were good. My only regret is the dessert - the three scoops of homemade ice cream was divine, but when I saw the apple pies just come out of the oven on my way out, I was kicking myself. Their brunch menu looked yummy too so will try next time. Also, be sure to try their honeydew juice - delicious!!! P.S. The bathroom procedure is a little strange but funny. You go through the open kitchen - which is totally cool - and the staff presses a button to open up a wall for you, which leads you to the hotel part of the building. On the way back, however - unless I took the wrong way back - you don't have a buzzer or a button on your side (which makes sense, so as not to have access to the open kitchen) so you just knock on the wall, and the staff on the other side open it for you.

2002,Washington,2008-08-05,6TqhEBgSZBmQrjGIXObVgg,5, DC,"Let me start out by saying Blue Duck only made the jump from 4 stars to 5 because of the service.  The food was extremely well done, but somewhat ordinary.  I had trouble finding something on the menu that looked unique and tasteful.  The service, however, was on par with the best I have ever experienced.  Everything was perfect.  Next time you are eating someplace, watch your water glass.  See how often it goes unattended.  This a very basic thing that is often overlooked that you can use to rate service.  Our water glasses didn't even get close to being dry.  Nor did the tables on either side.  Things were presented beautifully by the staff and quickly and accurately cleaned.  I think I had just finished chewing my last bite and sat back in my chair when my plate magically disappeared and the table was instantly wiped clean.  The staff was courteous and knowledgeable about the menu and, more surprisingly, the wine list.  As I mentioned, the food was excellent, but seemed to lack an imaginativeness that the best restaurants share.  They do recognizable things in new and incredible ways.  Blue Duck serves recognizable dishes in recognizable but tremendously well done ways.  Go for the service.  It will raise your bar of what great establishments are all about.",Peter S.

My duck breast was good, but strangely tasted almost exactly like Canadian bacon! My wife's catch of the day was sub-par. When she mentioned it nicely to our waiter he, over our objections, removed it from our bill and gave us complementary desert wine with our deserts which also were free. The service was impeccable. We arrived 45 minutes early for our reservations and the hostess walked us to a table in the bar and came back personally to find us when the table was ready. The wait staff was great...even down to the people bussing our table. The decor was wonderful, though, the open space and glass/wood combined to make it noisier than expected...plus our table for two was 3 feet from two men conducting a business deal which we couldn't help but be in on.

Two others among us had iPhones.  Yelp said the Westend Bistro in the Ritz was open for lunch. So we walked over there (several blocks).  On the side door, a window-washer pantomimed unclear gestures signaling it might be closed.  ""But the internet said you're open,"" one of us piped up.  We checked the main desk of the hotel--nope, closed.  We passed by Ris--another Sunday brunch fave, but it too was closed. I started to realize that Saturday was a totally different situation.  I called a few more places that showed up on Yelp and Urbanspoon.  Closed.  Called the River Inn (which I'd once stayed at). Closed. We did not feel like walking up to Dupont since it was cold. Finally, we found the Blue Duck Tavern, itself inside the Hyatt.  The woman I called didn't seem to want us to come, but the kitchen was at least open till 2:30pm.  We should up at almost 2 (yes, nearly an hour wandering Foggy Bottom, all of us armed with smartphones, looking for ONE place open), and they were gracious enough to find us a table, and we did have our nice brunch and cocktails in a nice (and, yes, expensive) atmosphere. The open layout is sort of like they want you to be ""in the kitchen""---you can see *some* of the food preparation going on. I ordered eggs benedict, but what it was two really tiny sausage patties, apparently a pheasant crépinette (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr…), but tasting essentially like a more buttery, softer, coarser version of a sausage patty.  It may be the smallest portion of food I've ever had for $18.  But the mimosa was refreshing, and the $6 espresso fairly decent.  If I had lots of expendable income and didn't mind eating less, I'd definitely come here again.",RJ U.

The hostess was so sweet, there was an issue with the parking meters outside and she assured us they have been broken for as long as she worked there and we wouldn't get a ticket, she was right, no ticket! We had reservations at 6 and were seated immediately, no ""please wait at the bar.""Our waitress was sweet as pie! I asked for some bizarre drink (because I am a jerk sometimes) and she had them make it, it was delish! Then we had the bone marrow appetizer, it was my first time ever having this and it was amazing! For dinner we had the crab cakes, braised beef, macaroni and cheese, and french fries. The braised beef is by far the BEST thing I have ever eaten. The flavor is out of this world and its like butter, no need for a knife! The crab cakes were good but I wouldn't order them again, but thats probably just personal preference since I am not a fan of mustard sauces! We had the french fries and macaroni and cheese for the sides. The french fries were really good, but I would try something else next time. The macaroni and cheese is out of this world. Its not like anything I have ever had before! Delicious! For dessert we had the apple pie with some of the vanilla ice cream. Holy Moly - Fantastic! It was super thick and the crust was to die for! It was perfect with their vanilla ice cream! Delicious! It is absolutely something you should try! Also, I'm not a fan of a stuffy atmosphere and there was not even a hint of it here! My new favorite restaurant, by far!",Lucy B.
2007,Beachwood,2011-12-05,AjauYt7KYMFyy1yUZaJOdw,2, OH,"There is no other word to describe the service but horrible.  Our reservation was at 1:45pm on a Saturday afternoon for a party of 7.  We arrived a few minutes early but were constantly (and arrogantly) reminded that our reservation was not until 1:45.  Okay...but we were not even seated until 2:10pm.  We placed drink orders and 5 out of the 7 drinks were delivered. After another 10 minutes we tracked down a waiter at another table asking what happened to our drinks.  Finally we place our food order.  Again...a big mistake.  The order was incorrect and they forgot one of the meals.  Admittedly, the food was tasty but by then we were so aggravated by the sloppy service that we were not fully enjoying the meal.  And the staff did NOTHING to apologize for the service and the mistakes.  Not even a complimentary dessert or something.  There are plenty of other great restaurants in DC so avoid this one and go somewhere where customers are treated with respect and excellence.",Debbie H.
2008,Washington,2008-03-21,zGyZSmm6s541sHEBKFjuxg,5, DC,"DC has a splendid array of restaurants. Diverse cuisines and styles give diners an almost impossible plethora of options allowing the possibility of a different, fabulous dining experience every night of the week. However, having eaten at Blue Duck Tavern, I am now tempted to eat only THERE every night of the week. My experience at the Blue Duck couldn't have been any better. I was dressed to impress, in the company of a good looking man...a good start. From the moment we walked in service was impeccable. Smiling faces at the hostess stand led us to a table that seemed a bit crowded (one side had my companion sitting on a long long bench, which was actually a very cool piece of furniture), but the people on either side of us were very friendly, and very into their food. Our waiter, Isaiah, was really great. Friendly, candid and not overbearing. He explained that dinner was served a la carte, so we promptly ordered: dungeness crab mac and cheese, house cured terrine of pork, oysters, new york strip with MELTED onions, braised brussel sprouts with bacon and the fries. For dessert we had the apple pie and espresso. Everything I put in my mouth was delicious. Oysers were plump, briny and fresh, and came with a great shallot/red wine vinegar sauce. Dungeness mac and cheese was creamy, crabby and baked. Terrine of pork was delicious and came with a small arugula salad dressed with grainy mustard and accompanied by hard boiled quail eggs, turnips and pickled onions. New York strip melted in my mouth! The fries were good, but not as good as hyped up to be. Brussel sprouts were great, with big chunks of home cured bacon. Apple pie was crusty, appley and sugary, and came with homeade ice cream. Literally everyone was delicious and the serving style was interesting as well. Blue duck has a very clean, yet homey aesthetic. Mid century modern chairs and tables mixed with shiny marble, glass and metal surfaces. The kitchen is open so that diners can kind of mix in with the chefs and check out what's going on behind the scenes. Everything met my expectations and exceeded. I would like to mention that service is something that really makes or makes my dining experience. This was a great exception to most of the service experiences in the DC dining scene. Polite, friendly and *gasp* HELPFUL! I recommend BDT to the most scrupulous diners...which is why I will be taking my mother there next week. If mama ain't happy...",Ellen F.

Marie,2010-05-05,Lm6HPFsvzVfRehSXN659Tg,4, MI,"Sure I'd been DYING to eat here forever and I had a sneak peek from the steak fries and lava cake, but really, I left a little underwhelmed. Maybe it was the anticipation.  We just winged it on Saturday night at around 7:45 and were able to get an outdoor table for two without even waiting! I was stoked.  We started with bone marrow and a bottle of Malbec.  The wine was delish (and I usually don't like red wine). We ordered one wine, but then before our server opened the bottle she wanted us to taste another one just in case we liked it better. And we did. I thought it was a generous move on her part :-).  So bone marrow was gross. I don't know what the big fuss is about, but I'm glad I at least tasted it.  Anyway, we ordered the pork, the beef rib, the fennel with almonds and the rappini.  We also got an order of the duck fat fries.  My pork came out undercooked so I sent it back to get it well done. The flavor was good. It was in some type of mustard seed sauce that was light and a little tangy.  The vegetables were good, but a tad too greasy.  They were very fresh though and that is important. The fries were amazing, but not as good as the steak fries they have at the lounge. Note to self. Anyway, by the time dessert came around I literally thought I was going to give birth I was so full.  But alas, we ordered the apple pie and the chocolate lava cake with rice crispie treat.  Our server (seriously this woman was so kind) offered to bring us complimentary sorbet and ice cream since I couldn't decide between that and the apple pie. She gave us a scoop of each: Mango sorbet (best I've ever had), vanilla (good, but BORING!), and maple walnut. OH MY GOSH maple walnut is a new fave flavor. I'd go back just for that. I only took a small taste of the pie and cake and both were good, although the rice crispie treat was kind of bitter.  The service is impeccable, the food is good and fresh. With only 4 more weeks left in the city I'm glad I finally got to try it!",Lia D.

2015,Arlington,2011-01-30,HRUUHYVoN7w383gsRd0-gA,3, VA,"Very attentive, unobtrusive service. We fell in love with the decor from the moment we enter through the towering double doors. The modern married to farm themed decorations and the sun streaming through the large windows made this a great setting for a cold Sunday morning. The wait staff and hostesses are all dressed in pinstripe suits - is this a nod to Washington's conservative dress code? It felt odd to be waited on staff dressed for the office. Coffee arrives in lovely individual pots though it was tepid and I was not in the mood to send stuff back. Pot number two was steaming. The bread basket was full of chewy, crusty bread. But for brunch a pot of jam to set the morning mood would have been nice. My daughter ordered eggs Ben (we had just seen the movie Somewhere) and I ordered the crab meat omelet. We shared the triple fries. Triple must mean size, they were large spears of potato and zingy with salt but not my favorites. I prefer thin super crunchy french fried potatoes. The Eggs Ben were on top of sausage (did it say this on the menu?) and arrived looking a bit lonely on an undecorated plate. Daughter liked them very much. My omelet also looked a bit under dressed on its plate, all alone. It was decent but frankly did not match the ambiance or the high prices of this restaurant. There was crab in it but not so much that I said ""ooh"" and the eggs were a bit overdone for my taste. Aren't omelets and such egg dishes suppose to be just on the cooked side of runny so that your mouth is greeted by a creamy feel rather than dry? We did not order dessert but the list looked tempting. Those around us were scooping their own ice cream from glass buckets. Where do people put all that food? And when will our menus offer choices like fresh fruit for dessert? Would we come back again? Some day. It was a very relaxed place to linger and feel Washingtonian.",Faylinda K.

2017,Salem,2009-06-02,Um8d5I9pDW0OMRL4IxvhNw,5, MA,What an amazing meal...I brought people who came from out of down to dinner here and everything we ordered was quite good. I would recommend the short ribs and the hen both dishes were just perfect. The Cheese grits side dish are a must. I did not try the bone marrow but I have heard great things. The split pea soup was very unique and brought out in a small brass pot and poured over a great looking ravioli. The only disappointing part of the meal was desert I would stick to the hand churned ice cream which is absolutely amazing.

The Chestnut soup with burnt marshmallows was very hearty but not overly filling. My braised beef short rib was huge, extremely tender, and absolutely delicious. My girlfriend and her father also raved about the steaks they had. The goatcheese grits were also quite good, which I wasn't expecting since I'm not a big grits fan. Overall, the food was quite good and the atmosphere was great, with the open kitchen and the very friendly staff. The only quibbles I had were that the menu online isn't clear that the sides are all ordered a la carte, which makes the restaurant appear cheaper than it is and that the service, at times, seems to try too hard, flying to a table to do the smallest of chores. Still, Blue Duck Tavern is definitely a premier DC restaurant.",Joseph H.

We were never without water or beverage (which is HUGE for me).  The servers recommendations were great.  We had sweet potato fingerlings, beef with red wine shallots, garlic pork sausage, potato puree, and the honey almond ice cream...

Service was wonderful! Our waiter was very warm and personable, and the rest of the staff was very attentive and accommodating. The food was fantastic! They brought us complimentary bread and butter to start, and upon request, a plate of locally-made jams (free of charge and very nice). We split the seasonal quiche and the pancake. The quiche that day was an oil-cured artichoke and ricotta quiche with fried scallions on top. Nothing complex, but very good. The pancake was absolutely heavenly. It was a new menu item: Lemon ricotta souffle pancake with a lemon poppyseed gastrique. To die for! The pancake was super thick and fluffy, and the lemon poppyseed syrup was fantastic. It was the consistency of a honey, and you could actually see the lemon zest in it. Great coffee too, served in your own personal pot at the table. Even though we were full from our meal, we decided to order the apple pie to taste after seeing it when we walked into the restaurant and hearing our server rave about it. Some of the best apple pie I've had! We just had a view bites, and our waiter boxed up the rest of the pie for us to go.The total bill for two breakfast entrees, two different pots of coffee and dessert, with tip, was about $60.

2029,Triangle,2009-12-19,Vi2Rq6z32hYG440197uLDA,3, NC,"I'm torn between giving this place two or three stars. We ate here two nights ago. Overall I would say the food was okay. But after reading many glowing reviews here on yelp, I was expecting a lot more. Here is what we had:bone marrow appetizer: I've never had this dish before. The flavor was very rich and we both enjoyed this appetizer very much. Although I would have appreciated someone mentioning that it is mostly fatty blobs that you remove from the bone and place onto a piece of toasted bread. So if anyone is particularly averse to gelatinous fat, they may not like this dish.duck breast: I ordered this as my main course. It was good, but nothing I would go out of my way to order again or come back for.beef rib: My husband had this. I liked this better than the duck breast. I would order this if I came to the Blue Duck Tavern again, but it's not something I would make a special trip back here to get. It was very tender.leek side dish: Very tasty as leeks sauteed in butter seasoned with salt and pepper go.french fries: A disappointment. The exterior was a little tough, not light and crisp as I would prefer french fries to be. To be honest, I would pick Five Guys french fries over these any day.apple pie and vanilla ice cream: I had read several people on yelp say this was one of the best apple pies in the United States and expected that even if it wasn' t the best apple pie I had ever eaten, that it would at least be up there. This apple pie was a HUGE disappointment. The apple pie filling was too dry (there was not enough sauce covering the apples) and the apples were too tart or there was not enough sugar to combat enough of the tartness. The crust was not that great either. It was not flaky and was too tough. I told my husband while we were in the restaurant that if I could choose between eating this apple pie and a piece of Mrs. Smith's frozen pie, I would pick the Mrs. Smiths! That's how much I did not like this pie! I was very disappointed in the ice cream too. It honestly tasted like a cheaper brand vanilla ice cream from a supermarket. The vanilla flavor was not very rich and the ice cream itself was not very rich either. I am not the kind of person to send things back unless there is a sanitary issue or something like that. So when the waiter asked how everything was, I just nodded and said, ""Good."" I don't think we'll return to this restaurant. Maybe if we lived in DC, we would give it another try eventually.

Hubby had the beef short ribs and we split the mashed potatoes. Beef ribs were excellent, and the mashed potatoes were TO DIE FOR. I didn't care for the ambiance, however, hence the 3 stars. I had heard (obviously mistakenly), and due to the homey-sounding name, that Blue Duck was a homey, comfort-food kind of place. I was expecting a homey, small, intimate restaurant. This place is attached to the Park Hyatt, the music is thumping, it's hard to have a conversation, tables are squeezed close together, and it seemed oh-so-trendy to me. Had I not been expecting something else, I might not have been so taken aback by the loud and trendy crowd. The other downside was the restaurant is like a labyrinth- a really weird and confusing design. That said, the food was very good and I would go back if someone else wanted to. But I wouldn't seek it out- there are just as many good and even better restaurants in DC with ambiances more to my liking.",sarah s.

Standouts included the roasted brace of quail appetizer, the poached quince, lettuces & herbs salad, the braised beef rib (one of the best beef dishes I've ever had, each chunk seemingly a perfect blend of beefy flavor and succulent fat) and the homemade snickers ice cream with caramel sauce. One weird note was the odd behavior of the sommelier. After I asked for assistance in choosing a wine, noting thay we preferred a pinot noir to go with my beef dish and my wife's fish, the sommelier produced a bottle and without showing it to me, opened it and offered a taste. I had to wonder what they would have done if I refused it. It was quite good and we accepted it. Strangely (for this business) it was one of the least expensive wines on the list. But how was he to know that I would have wanted that bottle? What I'm getting at is there was no communication. No options. No discussion at all. Turned out well but might not have. Then, we were charged for two bottles. Something I did not realize until later when I checked the online price list because I was not told of the bottle's price at the time it was offered. Management was responsive over the phone in promising to credit back to the card the bottle price plus tax. I look forward to a return visit.",Jim C.

We were seated in the lounge, which had great ambiance - dim lighting, comfortable soft chairs, and cool music.  I ordered a delicious champagne pomegranate cocktail - my first of two. It made me curious to try their other drink choices. We started our food order with a few different cheeses. The pairings they put together were delicious - goat cheese with apricots and aged cheddar with raisins.  After that, we decided to share the steak entree and a side of garlic mashed potatoes.  The steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly.  The fries were tasty, and the garlic mashed potatoes mouth-watering. Finally, we ordered their chocolate cake. I thought it was too rich. I could also taste the brandy that they poured on top and lit up when they brought it out.  However, my husband loved it and happily polished it off.  We left feeling very satisfied, and we want to go back with our friends for another great experience.  Perfect for a date night or cocktails with friends. One last note, the service was great.  Our waiter was helpful, attentive, and friendly.",Vanessa E.

2037,Washington,2007-10-18,2qvUj0q4LDWvf0p1WEuZnA,4, DC,"I finally had the chance to have dinner at the Blue Duck Tavern, and I must say overall, it was a very nice experience.  The atmostphere and decor of the restaurant is very much my style- posh and modern and in nice juxtaposition to the style of the food- elevated but still traditional.  The highlights of the meal were: the wine and the wine list-very extensive with VERY reasonable prices, the squid appetizer- perfectly cooked with a deliciously seasoned sauce, the roasted lobster and the vanilla bean ice cream.  The low points were: the bread basket- cold, stale, nothing special for a fine dining establishment, the foie gras appetizer- what did they do to foie gras? I normally love foie gras, but this was whipped into a thinly textured spread that had an unappetizer color and tasted like a strange cheese.  The peach, spiced walnut and poppy seed toppings would have been a fabulous pairing with some real foie gras. Also, the braised long rib- while the texture of the meat was divine (tender, literally falling off the bone) the bbq sauce tasted like ketchup...i wouldn't be surprised if that's what they use as the base. So that was kinda disapointing for such a fine place.  But overall, the experience was great- good service, attentive but not overbearing and the atmosphere and overall quality of food is wonderful.",Mollie I.

2039,Washington,2011-02-22,OedBwcmURBJ6zW-3nDNuyQ,2, DC,"Went here for my anniversary last Thursday.  We were greeted warmly but once Janet napolitano walked in with her secret service agents, our server seemed to lose  interest in us.  We needed to flag down one of the food servers to try to get another glass of wine and the check was sort of tossed on our able at the end of the meal.  The food was ok.  One dish was marvelous, the braised beef rib.  Perfectly seasoned and falling off the bone.  The cauliflower soup needed salt, it was very bland.  For sides we got the sweet potato pie...this was all but inedible, it also lacked salt and the heavy pie crust was gluey and unappetizing.  The celery gratinee was also super heavy and gluey, it had enough salt but was so heavy we couldn't finish it.  The squash angilotti tasted good but had so much butter on them they felt a bit greasy.  The apple pie was cold and enough for 4 people.  They should really say how large it is on the menu.  I am sad because I was really looking forward to ths meal but I came away feeling sort of bloated and ignored.",Danielle f.
2040,Arlington,2010-02-26,eQqfhRlW1HtkcCyKBb9BxA,4, VA,"Good stuff.  I've had the roasted chicken and the strip steak.  Both dishes were good, but the place really sells itself on the apple pie.  The service has been great every time I've been.",Patrick M.

2043,Washington,2008-09-23,8VLNB_wmhlQEU8q6Hzo3qA,4, DC,"The Blue Duck Tavern, the signature restaurant of the Park Hyatt Hotel at 24th and M Streets in the West End, delivers American cuisine crafted in an old fashioned European hotel style.  Let's cut to the chase: This is a pricey restaurant, best enjoyed on an expense account.  We visited it recently when we decided to make brunch outdoors the only meal for a Sunday.  We opted for a table under one of the large patio umbrellas.  At 2:00 p.m., the Blue Duck's outdoor terrace was an otherwise charmless sunken courtyard framed by a large raised multi-tier fountain.  The birds liked the fountain.  We enjoyed watching the birds.  Diners arrived wearing jeans, shorts, and flip-flops.  One emptied his shopping bags and left the trash at his table.  (So much for the concept of ""business casual."")  Our server was a young Frenchman just finishing four months in the United States perfecting his English.  He was personable and very knowledgeable about the preparation of each of the dishes, and his service was unrushed.  The brunch menu is hefty, moving seamlessly from Belgian waffles and eggs-anystyle to steaks and chops, but the wine list is truly enormous.  Care to start your meal with a $280 glass of wine?  The Blue Duck Tavern offers one.  We demurred in favor of two $12 glasses of cabernet sauvignon.  All of the dishes our server brought us were sizable, rich with butter and cream, and -- especially to fans of Escoffier -- perfectly prepared.  We shared a Maryland soft-shelled crab sauteed in butter, a pate' of smoked mackerel and creme fraiche with capers on yeasty French country bread, a smallish fresh ""jumbo"" crabcake in remoulade sauce, an oversized helping of spaghetti squash in butter and herbs, and a piece of apple pie with caramel sauce -- really a French apple tart on steroids -- and every dish was excellent and fattening.  In a return to reality, the bill for brunch for two nudged into three-figure territory, and but for that I would have considered giving the restaurant another star.  For a special-occasion brunch outdoors, preferably on an expense account, the Blue Duck Tavern delivers.",Robert O.
2044,Princeton,2009-07-31,1xbNToUkYldUqQrxJXrtlw,5, NJ,"This place is the best restaurant in DC.  The service is terrific and the food is too.  The customers there are usually upbeat and when I sit inside usually wind up conversing with some very briefly.  Outside seating it seems people are different - I once was extremely bothered by some guy who I think just got out of jail.  The restaurant staff either did not know or care, not sure.  Needless to say, I always get the chicken, mashed potatoes and mushrooms and it is always amazing!  Other than that one very bad experience I think it is still the best.",jason d.
2045,Washington,2009-09-15,VrWY_nMxJB9q-0wznbPrDg,4, DC,"Sunday brunch was amazing. Very friendly. This place will change your stereotype of a DC hotel restaurant. Modern and hip but not too much so. Love the open kitchen. Staff can be pushy a times, but letting them talk us into the fresh croissants, on top of my omelette, was definitely worth it. The Bloody Maria is a must try. Also, if under 30 expect to have your table pushed if it's busy and they don't think you're going to spend much money. Great experience, will definitely be going back for dinner in the future.",John W.
2046,Washington,2009-09-12,XrEnYAR2aoteriv9gHfHrQ,4, DC,"I basically agree with all the other reviews - the ambiance is great (we sat outside), the menu selection is larger than you would expect for this kind of restaurant, and the service is great. It is a great place to share - everything is plated separately and divided into shareable portions. We split 4 sides among three people and had plenty left over. We started with the scallops, which were fantastic with a great sauce, had the fries while we waited for our entrees, and had the carrots, brussels sprouts, and grilled mushrooms with the beef rib, ribeye with bone marrow sauce, and the roasted chicken. The beef dishes were both great - the chicken had been brined and was incredibly salty. The apple pie lived up to its reputation. I was also impressed with the wine list, and the cocktails. We really lived it up and spent about $100/person, with tip. I'm a fan.",Sarah B.

2048,Herndon,2011-11-13,b1y9JXYMbMtTfepu3WC-Bw,3, VA,"I'm writing for an experience we had 3 months ago so i don't remember every detail....The decor is beautiful! Makes you wish it was in your home..... and the greatness ended there for us. We came on a Thursday night around 7:30 to have a bite at the bar. We sat and ordered drinks and then asked for the menu, which we were given. I ordered a Hendricks and tonic and the wife ordered a Manhattan, both were good, the tonic they serve with the Hendricks is great but they leave you with the leftover from the individual personal bottle it comes in... as an industry person I look at this as a waste... especially since I'm not getting an extra shot of the gin with it. Anyhow, the bartender is nice and introduces himself, asks us what we would be interested in to munch on so we ordered 2 sandwiches. That's when everything turned upside down, we were told verbatim ""I''m sorry, you won't be able to order from that side of the menu. That side is for hotel guests only."".... We were stunned! Who in their right mind would limit a menu based upon whether you stay in the hotel or not... You just lost money when it costs you nothing extra. We paid our tab for the drinks and left. I will give the bartender this though... he was fully ashamed he had to say it and apologized. We called around and tried to get reservations elsewhere but all were packed till 9:30. So we decided we would give the Duck another shot and dine in the dining room. We had been so lucky to walk up just as someone had canceled and were seated within 5 min (that was good). We ordered the same drinks that we had at the bar and they were equally good, along with the wasted half bottle of tonic water (again a bloody waste, who wants to water down their drink?). Server was a little overly dramatic but knowledgeable for the most part. We had appetizers (dont remember what they were but I guess that means they weren't memorable). For dinner I had bison shank and wife had beef. We both wanted sides, one mashed potato and the other mixed greens. The server then proceeded to suggest that we not order both since the portion sizes for the sides were made to share.... (I'm sorry, now you're DOWNselling???) We appreciated the heads up and picked the greens but when they arrived they were not as big as she had made them sound...needless to say I missed my mashed potatoes. Shank was dry and not very flavorful and the same was  said about the beef. Sauce was thick and burnt, not pleasing to the pallet. We ordered ice cream for dessert because we were afraid of the other desserts being a disaster as well. Ice cream was good, we did enjoy that. All in all we will most likely not come back. Shame though because we had heard good things about the place and its Chef... perhaps the stars just weren't aligned in our favor that night.",Twirkle W.

The waitstaff was polite but a bit stuffy (what did you expect). The food was great (special mention for the side order of mushrooms- outstanding), and the presentation was spotless. Expensive wine list, but again this is to be expected. Save this place for special occasions (unless you're rolling in dough); I believe the food is worth the hefty bill.",Xavier W.

2052,Arlington,2009-04-25,aDNriLU9dCu18I-twu387A,4, VA,"Not much to add from last posting.  Still an awesome adventure with a steep price tag (but well worth it).  We took my wife's parents and they greatly approved.  My only hesitation to giving 5 stars was that service slowed almost to a stop between apps and entrees.  Total dining time almost topped 2 hours!!   Also, drinks were borderline overly sweet (simple syrup sugary).  Finally, we noticed other tables received a chef's tasting of pancetta while we were not.  No biggie, but at these prices, details matter.  I still LOVE the food and the non-pretentious attitudes of the staff.  This could be the type of place that makes you feel uncomfortable by the wait staff, but they do an excellent job making you feel comfortable.  No gourmet intimidation here.  When all is said and done, you will find yourself asking ""when should I come back?""  The answer is always, ""Soon!""",Kevin M.

The food itself was just fantastic, between the four of us we had the scallops,  branzino fish (special) the agnolotti, braised beef rib, ""mac and cheese"", salade with anchovies, and it was all FANTASTIC. so flavourful, savory, not too heavy, altogether just right. and the dessert. that's a whole other experience, it was phenomenal! we had the chocolate cake, pear and blackberry crumble, Crispy Figs with Mascarpone Cheesecake & Port Glaze, Chocolate cinamon, Pineapple macadamia and peanut butter ice cream...to die for...words cannot express how excited our taste buds were. seriously, we make a point to try a new restaurant every month, but we left there all in agreement that we wanted to come back for more...like, now! the food is fantastic, but it truly is the combined experience of the service and attention to detail that makes this an overall incredible experience. thank you Jamie for a wonderful evening at the blue duck tavern!",nathalie z.

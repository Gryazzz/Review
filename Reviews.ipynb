      "We returned for dinner at the Blue Duck Tavern and were far more impressed than on previous occasions. The foie gros creme brulee was a unique and delicious appetizer. The rack of lamb (enough for two persons) was exceptional, although quite expensive, and the whole roasted fish (for us, red snapper), was succulent. Chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream, and strawberry rhubarb sorbet were all excellent choices for dessert. Even the cranberry nut bread was memorable. Service was gracious, if a bit slow. This was a costly meal -- more than $100 per person after tax and tip, without wine or other beverages. However, the food was better than at some two-star Michelin restaurants we have visited. We look forward to our next dinner here.Show less\n",

      "We reserved the Chefs Table for a partnership dinner last week. The group was full of wine lovers, foodies and business travelers that could probably tally hundreds of restaurant experiences every year in many cities. Given that - the table consensus was that this was truly a top three meal ever. The chef did an amazing job describing the five course experience, but was otherworldly with the food itself. The bone marrow was like candy. Duck was perfect. And cauliflower with a kick that made it unique. Better still, the dining was matched by the attentiveness and professionalism of the staff. Adrienne and her team were amazing. Great conversationalists, perfect with details, and I promise they knew everyone’s name by the end of the night. All of the little touches handled with precision. If you are looking for a true experience that will impress, there are not enough stars for the Blue Duck and their team. Great work and thanks. Show less\n",

Nothing seemed appealing on the menu so we ordered off of the bar menu. I got the burger with no bun and fries. I never order this when out - it was good, but was a last resort due to very little options that sound appealing. My fiancee is more of a foodie than I am and even he ordered from the bar menu. We did enjoy breakfast each morning so maybe the way to go is b-fast, brunch, lunch? Not sure what I'm missing with this one....but we loved other restaurants more.Show less\n",

It was comfortable for 16, and it was nice being separate because people were standing and talking before dinner. The restaurant picked the menu, which varied somewhat from the main menu, weighted toward seafood and vegetables at our request. Everything was served family style. The food was uniformly fabulous, and whatever you do, save room for dessert. Service was great throughout. It's an expensive fixed-price experience to use that room, but that's apparent from the outset. Would not have changed a thing.Show less\n",

      "We had what was probably our best dining experience in DC at Michelin-star rated Blue Duck Tavern. Located in the Hyatt hotel that is literally across the street from our Westin Georgetown hotel, the Blue Duck Tavern is huge, gorgeous, full of space and light, with a professional staff and knock-your-socks-off food.The place was packed on a Wednesday night, and we were given a table right in the center of the party. Unfortunately, we struggled to hear each other and asked to be moved to a quieter table. They did so without hesitation and without attitude. Our server, Frank, was the pro you hope for when you come to a restaurant like this: knowledgeable about the entire menu, eager to recommend when asked, and offering tons of useful information to food fanatics like ourselves. He even gave us a tour of the restaurant and kitchen after we placed our order. This dude knew what we wanted!The foie gras creme brulee was an absolute knockout. The bone marrow with pretzel crumble was without a doubt the best I’ve ever had, and I’m a bone marrow freak. I have been spoiled for life. Of course, if you come to a place called the Blue Duck Tavern, you must have the Moulard duck breast…fabulous. And my wood oven roasted whole branzino in a sunchoke romesco sauce, all 1 1/2 pounds of it, was devoured by yours truly with only bones to show for it. My usually picky daughter had a feast with the charcuterie and cheese plate followed by a plate of rich ricotta gnudi.A great wine selection, wonderful house cocktails, assistance without attitude…it’s everything you want in a fine dining experience. I can’t give them another Michelin star, but I give the Blue Duck Tavern a solid 5 out of 5.Show less\n",

      "My husband and I had late lunch at the Blue Duck Tavern 2 weeks ago. We’ve been trying to eat at the Michelin starred restaurants in DC and we loved this one! The bread that is served is beyond delicious. I couldn’t top eating it and I usually only have a small bite of bread otherwise I get too full. For an appetizer my husband and I shared the jumbo lump crab cakes and they were so good. The crab cakes were almost all crab meat with very little filler. For our main meals I got the grilled octopus and my husband got the Chef's choice which was a NY Strip. Both were incredible! We got two sides: mushrooms and grits........yum! Every bite of everything was literally to die for! For dessert we shared the Meyer Lemon Castella which was not only delicious to eat but looked incredibly beautiful. I’m not sure how we managed to fit it in but we had cocktails that were also incredibly good. I had the Soooo Good which is a cucumber Vodka based drink and my hubby has the Carry Me Away which is Spicy Tequila based, we recommend both!We will definitely go back to Blue Duck Tavern and we feel that the Michelin Star is well deserved.Show less\n",

As we were taking photos in the Blue Duck wine cellar, a waiter that had served us twice before, Michael Hillman, recognized us, dropped what he was doing, and rushed over with two glasses of bubbly so that we could toast the occasion. While that alone was incredibly touching and showed Blue Duck's incredible commitment to detail, when we got back to our room, Michael had sent up a hand-written note congratulating us.

      "Don and Michael made this special birthday dinner extraordinary. There were seven of us, and from start to finish, the evening was filled with delicious food, good humor, and -- joy. Yes, joy in the delight that Don and Michael showed in their restaurant and in serving us, and our own joy in sharing our special moment with two wonderful individuals who cared for us as if we were family. Don presented the menu choices in a way that we had never experienced at any other restaurant. It was soon apparent that each ingredient and each preparation reflected considerable thought, and there was genuine warmth and a touch of excitement as Don described each offering and then shared our happiness with what was presented. Don reviewed the choices for us, and Michael served. These gentlemen love their \"job\" and could not have done anything to make us feel more special.The cocktails were fun -- a park bloom, a sooo good, a subpoena, and others. We then shared starters -- baby gem salads (pine nuts, fennel, baby carrots, and roasted carrot dressing), a cheese and charcuterie board (with remarkable cheeses, such as ceremont, and delicious meats), their famous wood oven roasted bone marrow with toast points, and roasted cauliflower with tahini, cashew butter, chermoula and raisins. The bread, meanwhile, was wonderful -- especially the cranberry walnut bread. Then we had the pleasure of the main dishes -- a braised pork shank; the braised beef rib (which cooks for 17 hours and comes with mustard spatzle - let Don/Michael describe it for you :) ), the wood-oven fired butcher's cut (a scrumptious, perfectly cooked steak). Sides included salt-baked beets (with red wine maple vinaigrette), white corn grits with goat cheese and an heirloom apple compote, remarkable roasted wild mushrooms with baby spinach, hand cut BDT fries, and ricotta gnudi. Again, ask Don/Michael to describe the gnudi. :)Yes, we made room for dessert -- the famous apple pie (granny smith, gala and honeycrisp), mandarin custard, guanaja tart, pear dumpling, and several scoops of special ice cream and sherbet. The funny thing about this dinner was that our expectations were very high and then the expectations were surpassed. We had read about food, service, decor, and the Obamas' anniversary dinner at the Blue Duck. For a few hours, we felt like WE were the first family. Hats off to everyone -- chef, manager, cooks, servers, and our new friends Don and Michael. Wow.Show less\n",

      "The Saturday (3/31/2018) before Easter I was very fortunate to have brunch with family at Blue Duck Tavern – a beautiful contemporary Michelin Star restaurant in Georgetown. Cutting to the chase brunch was excellent and did not disappoint, service here is impeccable, and the space is modern, open, and airy which makes it perfect for brunch and truly seeing and enjoying the whole experience. Finding the hostess stand was a bit of an Easter Egg/treasure hunt since it is hidden behind one of the columns in the middle of the restaurant. Being a benedict fan, I had the BDT Benedict which was amazing. The unique combination of pork with mustard hollandaise made the dish satisfying while still being lighter than the standard eggs benedict. My Café Park cocktail was perfection – the balance of Grand Marnier, Expresso, and Orange was an energetic and refreshing start to the day. I plan to come back for dinner and highly recommend Blue Duck Tavern.Show less\n",

Once settled in we met our lovely server who congratulated us and gave us his personal recommendations. We found that the food was spectacular and loved every bite we took! When it came to dessert our server recommended their famous apple pie but we decided against it because we were stuffed and knew that it was a huge serving. Our waiter took it upon himself to bring us a complementary kid size apple pie and vanilla ice-cream for us so that we could still have the experience after hearing us debate which item to order.

Stations throughout for dessert, charcuterie, garde manger. Our anticipation grew.We were sat and our server was over the top! Funny, knowledgeable.... the chef had black river duck on the menu.... while we declined we were even more excited.We ordered several dishes to share, charcuterie, gnudi, Mushrooms, foie gras brûlée, their signature house made fries and beets.The gnudi was more of a gnocchi and cold. The wild mushrooms were flavorful and but cold, beets the same. Foie gras was great but and everyone else at the table enjoyed but not to my personal liking, due to texture. The charcuterie hadn’t any pates, rillettes, etc. For the price paid one could expect some craftmanship.The house made fries were the best dish we tried all night, thick and cooked Jon beef fat... delicious.After that we ordered some entrees. The beef rib was tender but mismatched with its accompaniments. The pork shank was sub par.We looked at the desserts but none were appealing, I understand savory desserts but the pairings sound off.The only thing that sounded off the charts was the apple pie for two. The picture looked great on the website. I’m sure it was delicious but after walking by the station where it was being prepared and saw the size of it we thought it was too expensive. $24 is insane. I say that after spending $350 for dinner. I can say the service was great! Attentive and friendly. We would come back just for that. We may pack our own dinner though.Maybe it was just an off night. It happens.We were disappointed.We hope that you have a better experience for the price and hype.Show less\n",

      "I really hate to do this but I must give the Blue Duck Tavern a less than stellar review. I have been to the Blue Duck on more than a few occasions and I am usually pleased with the quality of the food even when the services had been off. My most recent trip found just the opposite. The service has improved quite a bit but the kitchen let everyone down. Uneven kitchen service led to an unusually long wait for entrees and when they arrived they were flat out cold. After sending one entree back (Duck) it was barely heated to room temperature. The waiter apologized and did his best to overcome the situation which was appreciated but the kitchen let us down in a very disappointing way. I still would recommend Blue Duck but perhaps on a night when they are less busy with bigger groups. It seems the kitchen was overwhelmed by its popularity. Show less\n",

Their coffee was strong, yet was very smooth; a very good breakfast roast. I can definitely recommend BDT and will visit again!Show less\n",

The Short Rib Hash was ok but not worth $22 as the biscuit was really dry and unappetizing. The only redeeming factor was the perfectly executed sunny-side eggs for both of our dishes.

The space was perfect for our group of 13 - beautiful and quiet. Marvina was a pleasure to work with. We are all adventurous eaters and so the idea of a tasting menu of the chef's choice based on availability of fresh ingredients was perfect for us and eliminated a lot of decision-making. Our dedicated servers were terrific, helpful without being intrusive. The presentation of each course by its chef was informative and, most importantly, everything was interesting and delicious. We ranged in age from 7 to 80 and everyone was thrilled. Blue Duck Tavern will certainly be my first choice for a special dinner party in DC!Show less\n",

      "In spite of the general belief that you should NOT take your beloved out for dinner on Valentine's Day, we did have dinner at the Blue Duck Tavern. It was a spectacular meal from start to finish. Because of the special holiday, the restaurant offered a prix fixe meal with four courses. There was something for anyone's taste buds! I won't comment on specifically what we had since I don't know if those dishes appear on the regular menu. But let me say that at no time did we feel like the restaurant was just going through the motions because it was Valentine's Day. The staff was wonderful: attentive from the moment we walked in to the time we left, but never intrusive. The meal was paced well - no rushing through the courses. I am very sensitive to noise levels, but I felt that my husband and I were able to carry on a good conversation without straining to hear or be heard.This is def a special occasion place, but worth a visit. fortunately for me, I have just such an occasion coming up - my birthday - and the Blue Duck Tavern is where I want to celebrate!

      "Based on the fabulous reviews Blue Duck Tavern has received, my granddaughter and I made reservations to dine there. Based on our dining experience we felt we had come to the wrong restaurant. To start with, we each had a glass of white wine. Both were served at room temperature. Thinking that we might have not ordered a popular wine therefore not being chilled, we let it go. On the good end we did order the bone marrow which was delicious. But then we ordered the Duck and the halibut. The Duck was not medium rare but almost raw and my halibut was minus taste and was cold. Considering that the kitchen was feet away from us, I was surprised to say the least. In addition,before we ordered the waiter told us that the fries were BDT fries. He didn't mention that the fries we ordered were not kin to any fries we might know. They actually appeared to be fried mashed potatoes. We ended the evening by ordering nonmemorable desserts. We did find the wait staff to be pleasant. Bringing over stools to put our bags on is a nice touch. I will admit I should have said something to our waiter, but in the past I have done that and such a scene was created by the manager and chef that I said to myself I would not do that again. Will I come back hoping it was just a bad night? I don't know.Show less\n",

The food was delicious and executed to perfection and that coupled with the service, made it five star experience. This will be my go to restaurant for my future visits to D.C. The chef's cut of beef was pan seared with a nice crispy crust and served with a sauce that everyone raved about.

The halibut was perfectly cooked and delicious. I tried to order the special, which was venison, but they were out of it despite our reservation at 645. I was surprised it was 86'ed so early in the night. The Brussels sprouts were soggy despite being described as crispy. They usually were one of the highlights of the side dishes at Blue Duck. Our server tried to rectify the sogginess twice but without success. The first mulligan led to more soggy sprouts. The second mulligan led to crispy but pretty burnt sprouts. Really not sure what is so hard about crispy Brussels sprouts....they really aren't hard to make. The wild mushrooms were very good...not as good as the trumpet mushrooms I've had many times at Blue Duck in the past. We didn't have dessert there because everything looked meh....this being said by the person who ordered 5 desserts for 2 people on one of my previous Blue Duck visits. I have two upcoming reservations...one on 3 Feb (friend's bday) and one on 18 Feb (gf's bday)....I'm most likely changing those to a different restaurant.Highlights of our night were the bone marrow and halibut plus the great service provided by our server.Show less\n",

The kitchen is open, the staff is super friendly, and more than willing to offer food recommendations as well as wine recommendations. We sat down, had cocktails and wine (which were delicious), and then had the Bone Marrow and Beef Tartar. Beef tartar was good and I think it was unique that they were able to dry age beef when tartars are supposed to be fresh. However, the Bone marrow was mind blowing. It contained that fattiness and salty taste in a bone marrow, but was topped off with a sweet tangy barbecue beef shreds on top and you taste both sweet, salty, and tangy all at the same time. Then, we had the slow cooked beef with au jus, the black squid ink pasta, and the NY Strip steak with sides of beet root and grits. The steak was perfectly cooked, very tender, minimalist cooking, pure, and clean and delicious. Squid ink was little salty, but had huge clams and the imperfections in the noodles added a delicious texture into the pasta. I have had black squid ink pasta before and I think you just taste more of the clean purity of the ingredients they used. Then, the slow cooked beef. OMG! Never had anything like it. The slow cooked beef was so tender, but had chimichuri sauce on top and it was salty, spicy, tangy, and the umami in the au jus sauce was just out of this world. Then we had vanilla ice cream with apple pie which was just mind blowing. The carmamelization of the crust on the apple pie was perfectly balanced with the vanilla beans in the ice cream and I think it was hands down the best dessert i have ever had. Nothing was overly sweet, but just the perfect final touch to a perfect clean dinner. I didn't feel gross even though my stomach was about to blow up.

With the Blue Duck Tavern, things are quite opposite: if you have dined at the restaurant, can you name the hotel where it is situated at? We ate dinner at Blue Duck Tavern for a belated birthday celebration. The restaurant is also open for breakfast and lunch which is fairly unusual for a high-end restaurant. The food was good, although only a few bites were truly excellent. The menu strives to highlight the restaurant's support for the farm-to-table movement. Most of the dishes could be categorized as American cuisine. Service throughout the establishment was excellent and accommodating to our requests. The decor is quite nice, although I would call it neither cozy nor upscale. Modern, perhaps. For a long dinner, the seating could have been more comfortable in the sense that the chairs and benches were wooden.

Others got the foie gras and soup starters.Entrees that we sampled included the steak, duck, fish of the day, and squid ink pasta with scallops. Preparations were well balanced and complex, and not fussy. We shared the side orders (at least one of each item on the menu). Everything was delicious, except that I was a little disappointed with the BDT fries which lacked crunch (mashed potatoes shaped into steak fries size, then fried).We shared a few desserts, the most memorable being coconut gelato.

      "The competition for high-end restaurants in Washington D.C. only seems to get tougher every year. Now with the Michelin Guide providing annual rankings, restaurants across the city are finding a competitive landscape unseen ever before in D.C. I've been to Blue Duck Tavern multiple times before and after they received their Michelin Star, and I find them to be in a league of their own in our nation's capital. Regarding food, their seasonally prepared fare is defined by their incredible oven. Anything that is roasted, from the short rib to the Brussel sprouts, is touched by an incredibly high heat which creates a flavor I've never experienced at any other restaurant. Everything on this menu is well thought out, with immense depth, which leaves you frustrated that food is not this good everywhere. The beverage program is incredible. The cocktails are unique and thought-provoking. The wine list is impressive in both size and scope. Lastly, and this is what sets Blue Duck Tavern apart from every other restaurant in D.C., is the service. On our last two visits, we've had Adrienne as our server. Adrienne, without fail, is the best server I've ever had. Her professionalism and knowledge of the menu, wine list, and restaurant are impressive. In combination with the rest of the staff–the hostess, food runners, and bussers–Blue Duck Tavern stands in a league of their own in the service category. If you ever have the opportunity to dine here (reservations must be made 2-4 weeks out), I would jump on it without hesitation. It's truly a special restaurant and one of the best in Washington D.C.

A bit pricey for what you get. Make that very pricey.Trout and stuffed quail were good. Brussels and bacon side could have used more bacon. Salads were good. Decent wine list.

We recently traveled to D.C. and stayed at the Park Hyatt specifically to have Thanksgiving there on her recommendation. The restaurant is an open kitchen which in this case really works , the atmosphere is a perfect blend of clientele that are visitors and locals.The food is always fabulous. I️ can guarantee you , you will not be disappointed. My only suggestion is for Thanksgiving ,although it was outstanding ,to go back to a buffet and incorporate some more traditional items, only because it is the one day a year when people are expecting to have certain foods.Show less\n",

      "Blue Duck is the general-purpose restaurant of the Park Hyatt. It serves upscale American food at popular prices, but is just too large and casual, and doesn't make you feel that you had a special dining experience. As I was staying in the hotel, I wound up eating there twice with relatives, and can especially recommend the short rib hash (savory, and not drowned in sugary tomato-based sauce like many restaurants do). However, the fried chicken biscuit was largely tasteless, and couldn't be awakened by a julienne of sautéed vegetables which just didn't harmonize.Show less\n",

Once identified that we wanted to order it was accommodated. I didn’t like the tea - it was loose leaf tea which is really nice but it took too long to get to the table making it too strong and needing extra water to be added. The provision of a heat source under the teapot was a bit gimmicky and not necessary. Overall as a Michelin Star restaurant this lived up to expectations of great tasting food and although expensive is worth it. Show less\n",

The “fries” were quite unique and the mushroom, grits and broccoli very well done. The desserts were excellent. Servers attentive once they found you.

      "Absolutely amazing! The Blue Duck definitely lives up to it's reputation and the reviews. My wife and I went there for our last night in DC. The complimentary bread basket sampler was very good along with the pumpkin butter. We had heard the reviews about the Bone Marrow and decided to start with that. It lived up to the hype. You would not be disappoint by it unless you are a vegetarian. My wife ordered a red wine while I ordered a dark stout beer. Both went equally well with her main course of the house special duck and the butcher's cut New York strip steak. Both of which were cooked perfectly and had extraordinary flavor. We went with the roasted brussel sprouts AND the beet root gnocchi for our sides. I told my wife I would go back again and again just for the beet root gnocchi. Having eaten in Paris, Nice, Rome and all over the U.S. I'd say the beet root gnocchi is one of the best foods I have ever had. For dessert we went with the triple cream panna cotta and the house favorite apple pie. Our server did warn us that the triple cream can come off a little strong to some people. I'll say this, while it was good, it had an almost goat cheese sharpness to it. The apple pie with vanilla ice cream is an old family recipe that you would not be disappointed with (and I'm a pie snob)! As apple pies go it is top notch. Also, our server David F. took great care of us and answered all of our questions. He helped my wife with her decisions on which things to get when she was undecided. He was awesome.Show less\n",

      "I will start the review with the price. This is not for the thrifty. It is a very nice meal, at a Michelin restaurant, with great service and great meal and it is priced accordingly, if you can get past that, you are in for a treat. The cocktail menu has several creative drinks, that were enjoyed by our party. My husband and I started with the bone marrow, which is one of their famed dishes. One is large enough to share and was delicious. They add tiny pieces of beef and you won't stop until you are done.... Don't pass this appetizer up. For entrees, part of our party ordered the duck. It is one whole duck cooked to perfection. More than enough for the four of them. Even though I am not a duck fan, even I had to admit it was tasty. My husband had the butcher cut, which that evening was New York strip. The steak was very good. I had the salmon and it melted in my mouth. The flavor was good and was complimented well with the sauce on the plate. The vegetables were a la carte and we split Brussels sprouts and the duck fries. They were both pretty fantastic. A panna cotta and frozen banana parfait were our dessert choices and they did not disappoint. Others at the table had the apple pie and it was good as well.Many of the the reviewers cited lacklustre service, but in our case, our waiter Dave, and his team provided excellent service to our party of 8.All in all an excellent experience.

      "For our latest visit to the wonderful City of Washington, D.C., we had just 4 \"Dining Together\" opportunities (M, my \"Better Half\" was attending a major Business Conference), so we did quite a bit of pre-planning : \"Blue Duck Tavern\" was high on our list of choices for a \"Special Night\".It may help \"Trip Advisor\" members (particularly with Cab Drivers) to know that this Michelin-starred Restaurant is actually located in \"The Park Hyatt Hotel\". The venue is absolutely modern in design : quite dark, and with extensive use of \"hard surfaces\", somewhat noisy.We were slightly early for our 7.30 p.m. Reservation, and our \"welcome\" was less than warm (a theme for the night, as transpired) : we were pointed towards a very busy Bar, with few available seats. Here, it should be said, we had a very pleasant Server (Jivan) who readily delivered 2 Glasses of a very acceptable \"Albarino\". We weren't very long sipping our Wine, when someone appeared from the Restaurant, saying \"your Table is ready - NOW\". Our transition was not exactly smooth - first we had to settle our \"Bar Tab\", and unlike other venues at this level, it was left to us to grab our Glasses and proceed into the Restaurant. Our designated Table was fine.The Menu presented is quite impressive, offering an \"unfussy\" selection of Soups/Salads, \"Starters\" and Meat/Poultry or Fish/Shellfish \"Mains\", with Potato/Grains & Vegetable \"add-on\" options. The Wine-List also impressed.Moving on, M enjoyed her \"Endive Salad\", while my own \"Foie Gras Terrine\" was also quite good. Sadly, things deteriorated from there onwards. For \"Mains\", M had selected the \"Braised Beef Rib\", while my own choice was \"Moulard Duck Breast\", to be accompanied by \"Crispy Brussels Sprouts\" and \"Hand-cut BDT Fries\". When all of these arrived, we immediately discovered they were not even \"warm\" - we sent them back (there was no argument) - the replacement Dishes were only marginally warmer - what can you say or do next ? Being quite hungry at this stage, we made an effort to eat as much as we could.Looking for \"positives\", we would say we enjoyed a Bottle of \"Albarino\" (M also had one Glass of \"Red\"). Our principal Server, Kristin, was extremely good throughout the night - pleasant & competent - but how could even she compensate for the decidedly poor performance of those who required her to deliver unacceptable Food Dishes to our Table ?We must acknowledge that our Check/Bill did not include any charge for \"Mains\", which is fair enough. We would also note that, in every other \"Michelin-starred\" Restaurant we've visited (and, indeed, several others less recognised), it is customary to offer an \"amuse bouche\" and/or a \"Sorbet\" : not so here.We departed \"Blue Duck Tavern\" quite disappointed with our experience on what was, to us, a \"precious night\". Oh, and by the way, when we politely enquired at the Restaurant's \"Reception\" about getting a Cab, we were bluntly told to go to the Hotel's Reception - there, we were even more abruptly told \"walk across the Street and you'll get one\". In our Country, we would be extremely embarrassed to hear that a visiting American had been treated in such an inhospitable way - as you might well imagine, we did not leave this venue with a \"warm glow\"....Show less\n",

I decided to do some non-traditional pairings of food with the bone marrow, a rainbow trout, finishing with desserts. My husband had the butcher's cut of meet; it happened to be a NY Strip one of his favorite. They have a nice variety of cocktails and a fine list of wine by the glass, including some local selections. Preparations were simple and didn't try to go overboard.

My \"Assorted pastries with seasonal jams\" are a rather bland selection of croissant, pain au chocolat and a coffee cake muffin, and arrive with no jams whatsoever. The eggs were poached well, hollandaise was well-balanced and the mushroom dish was good, so there was that.

The weather was fabulous and we walked all the way from a hotel near the White House. The interior of the restaurant is exquisite. The very tall doors to the entry, oversized light fixtures, and modern wood paneled walls create a beautiful calm feeling as you enter.Our waitress was Adrienne and she knew the menu well and made great suggestions to us. We both chose the duck as our entree since it is rare we see it on a menu. My husband started with the corn chowder which was perfect for a fall day and was served hot from a kettle poured into a bowl. The texture was smooth and the flavor almost smoky. My salad was also a delight and very fresh and beautifully designed.The star of the night was the duck. Served two ways. The breast meat's skin was wonderfully fried to a nice crunch and the meat cooked perfectly to the rarer side of medium rare. The leg was succulent with the meat falling off the bone as soon as my fork hit it.As sides, we had the carrots and butternut squash. Both were delightful and I went back and forth trying to decide which was better. A bit overpriced as a side but I am glad we got them. One of which was a gift from our waitress because she knew we were having a hard time deciding between the two.The cocktails and wine were also wonderful and I appreciated the heavy handed pour on the glasses of wine ordered. We did not save room for dessert but left with a complimentary bag of sugar cookies which we devoured later that night.This was a wonderful meal and a fabulous experience.

      "From the minute of your arrival to the end of dinner and departure you will be taken care of and eat and drink some of the best you’ve had. Our server, Shankar, immediately discerned I was a wino and that opened up more options for my drinking pleasure. The rest of the service was equally as attentive and enthusiastic. I had the strip steak with a side of wild mushrooms and spinach. Everything was superb; however, the house made sauce for the steak, a bordelaise sauce to be sure, was the best I’ve had. Two others shared the house special duck. I won’t get into all the details on how they make this, but order it! I couldn’t taste as I am allergic to fish and there are anchovies in the House made Worcester sauce. Not fair!Dessert was butterscotch pudding-I think I may not go home in order to get more of this!Will definitely have to come back here. My new favorite place. Show less\n",

      "I was searching through so many reviews trying to find the perfect restaurant for my first wedding anniversary. I am so happy we decided on Blue Duck. Michael was the most charismatic and attentive server and showed true interest making sure we had a memorable time. We had a personalized menu that read \"Happy Anniversary\" and the chef even signed it for us at the end. I enjoyed the scallops and my husband's duck so much and our choc mousse dessert was very moist and rich. I will definitely be back to check out the Fall menu, and I will specifically request Michael as a server. I highly recommend for special occasion or just to have a dinner full of fresh ingredients and great service.Show less\n",

To start off, the service was the BEST we have ever experienced, match that with the food and it is a solid 10! Our server Michael was personable, kind, and knowledgeable. He gave excellent recommendations when it came to the food, and explained the seasonality of the menu with the process of sustainably farmed items chosen for the creation of the chef's dishes. To start off we had their signature item of Bone marrow, we were hesitant at first but Michael convinced us and glad we took the suggestion! He even prepared mine first to show us how it is recommended to be enjoyed. The entrees were delicious, scallops very light and seasoned well. Along with the beef rib that was so tender, it fell apart just picking it up. For dessert, we were having a hard time to choose between the cheesecake or butterscotch pudding as we were pretty full. We settled on the cheesecake, but Michael surprised us and brought us the pudding as well since it was one of his favorites! Thank you for such an amazing meal and experience!Show less\n",

But, for the most part, I'm able to keep portion size reasonable, don't do desserts, etc. Thus my hatred, the chef capably addressing almost all my weaknesses. My wife and I started by splitting a sea bass crudo and a plate of bone marrow. The bone marrow was absolutely amazing. Three large pieces -- real large -- served with thick bread slightly toasted. Oh my. She had one and I had one. But not eat the third? Gobble. Hate. My wife wasn't wild about the sea bass, but that wasn't the sea bass'fault. I loved it and, despite my wife's small appetite for the dish, the plate left clean. More hate. For a main, I had the best Reuben I have ever had. Unreal house-made pastrami with fantastic house-made slaw. My wife had the seared tuna; again, perfect. We ate outside, which was delightful. The service was impeccable.

We made reservations several weeks in advance for the Blue Duck Tavern, glad we did there was a little crowd when we arrived. Our server, Michael, was out of this world. His bubbly personality and passion for the restaurant industry made our night. When we first sat down, he went over the menu, explained the restaurants' concept and suggested his favorite items on the menu. I asked if I could explore the restaurant, he said yes, and then proceeded to take us on a tour of the restaurant, kitchen and dessert area. During the tour, I felt like I was with Bobby Flay. Michael was well versed on all topics about the restaurant, including food preparation, where the ingredients come from and history of the restaurant. We were told we had to try the Bone Marrow as an app. We've never had Bone Marrow before and was a little hesitant, but when the food arrived Michael explained how to eat the dish. Holy cow was it good. As a side dish, we got the corn grits, best corn grits we've ever eaten and potato fries, they were extremely large fries. We split the Braised Beef Rib for our main dish. The meat was so tender we could cut it with a spoon. Very large portion of meat. For dessert, we tried the Butterscotch Pudding.

      "I went here for dinner with my 8yo son while staying at the Park Hyatt, DC. We made reservations on short notice via the hotel and were offered 8pm (only 9:15 was available on the web reservation system a few hours prior). We had wanted earlier but were told it was nothing was available, though several tables were empty when we arrived at 7:50. The decor was to my taste, think George Nakashima style. It clearly is a special occasion restaurant as there were several birthday candle dessert presentations but fortunately nothing too boisterous. The clientele was diverse, elderly to hipsters and children were clearly welcome. The service was a bit slow and in hindsight I thought the server could have guided a bit more in regards to the kids meals preparations, but they were accommodating. The cocktail choices were fresh and inventive. The wine selection was extensive, the beer selection much less so. Several plates were outstanding, the grilled beet salad in particular, and the oysters were excellent. The scallops were perfectly cooked, the pea concoction it was served with was good but, I was wanting a bit more lemon which I thought I read in the description of the dish, but I could be wrong. The roasted mushrooms tasted burnt which was unfortunate. The bread was rather average. The dessert selection was perhaps too innovative for me, think an episode of Chopped with poor basket options. I choose a coconut thing which was so-so, as nothing else seemed appealing except for the peach pie but it was presented as a dish for two. It did take a while to get attention from the server during the course of the meal but he was pleasant enough. The price was quite reasonable, especially for a Hyatt associated restaurant where overcharging is usually the norm.

      "My wife and I picked this place for our 5th wedding anniversary. During our five years we've eaten at 7 other Michelin Starred restaurants so I really feel we have an idea for what they should be. While this place is a very good restaurant I want to get into the weeds and be very picky as I feel a michelin star deserves to know the truth and I hope they improve. First the ambiance and decor is very nice. The people are friendly and the service is fine. We saw a lot of teamwork and people often double and triple check orders. We had a great table with a few of the kitchen and the plating islands so we saw a lot of how the operation worked. It wasn't too noisy, except for one young white jacket man who thought it was ok to yell orders into the kitchen, which was 5 feet behind him but it wasn't too bad. The food was a mixed bag, something a Michelin starred restaurant isn't known for. We were surprised there was no tasting menu or wine paring as every other Michelin star we've been to had one. I'm sure there are others but I was a little disappointed. I wanted to try a lot of their food in small quantities. They didn't even have a sommelier but the servers are very well versed in their wines. We started with the Wood Oven-Roasted Bone Marrow and the Seared Foie Gras & Lobster Terrine. Both were incredible. As a matter of fact the bone marrow was the best we've had and we definitely recommend it. Next we had the Braised Beef Rib and the Moulard Duck Breast with a duck leg confit. I highly recommend the braised beef as it was incredible but the duck was only so-so. The duck confit was pink inside and there is no way it was cooked over 3 hours. The best confit is cooked for 12 hours or more and then has a crunchy skin but this one was slimy with no browning at all. The breast was ok but really lacking for flavor. My wife cooks both so much better at home. So points for the beef but minus for the duck. Our sides, which you order separately were White Corn Grits, Oven-Roasted Asparagus with fried chicken skin and Roasted Wild Mushrooms. The grits and the mushrooms were both incredible. The asparagus was very good but lacked sufficient flavor for this level of restaurant. I wonder how fresh they were. Our dessert was ice cream and sorbet so I wouldn't normally mention it but both were fantastic as they were made inhouse. The rest of the deserts look fantastic but we just don't eat many sweets. Next time I may try the Apple Pie or Lemon Tart as both looked incredible. So overall we enjoyed the dinner but we do not feel it's up to a Michelin star and we do not expect it to be maintained. They seem like they are struggling with whom they want to attract. They had burgers and fries on their menu and they also had marrow and foie gras. They did a great job of not feeling like a hotel restaurant but I believe they should leave the burgers for lunch and concentrate on their dinner fair during the dinner meal. Just my two cents.Show less\n",

The charcuterie was excellent, the chef brought it to the table and explained what the offerings were. We had the duck and spare rib with mushrooms and broccolini as sides. The presentations were excellent and the preparation perfect. Topped off with excellent cheese cake, very light- unlike heavy NY style. Thanks Jeremy!Show less\n",

      "Five stars for great food and amazing service from Liz!This is my favorite restaurant in D.C. My mother and I went here last week for brunch and found out that brunch is only available during the weekends. Nevertheless, the lunch menu was phenomenal. We had the sakura green tea, braised beef rib, wild mushrooms, BDT fries, baby gem salad, and the apple pie with ice cream (of course). Everything was delicious! The braised beef was flavorful and melted in your mouth. The mushrooms were probably my favorite side. The salad was okay. The dressing was light, but the veggies here are so good you can honestly eat them on their own. The BDT fries were more like fried mash potato sticks. I liked them as a starch element for my meal, but on its own, regular fries are probably better. The apple pie with vanilla ice cream is a MUST. Just know that it is HUGE. Four people can probably share this dessert. You were warned. Our server Liz was AMAZING. She made great recommendations, was extremely patient with us, had great people skills, and went above and beyond what was required of her. I've worked in customer service for six years now and I am a server myself. I know good service when I see it. Liz made sure our drinks were always full, made sure we liked everything we received, cleaned the table every time I made a mess, checked up on us consistently and even brought us a brunch menu in case we wanted to come back during the weekend. Our experience was so great that we decided to return and we had Liz make us a reservation in her section. We came back today for brunch. BEST.MEAL.OF.OUR.ENTIRE.TRIP. We started with sorbet mimosas (to die for). Then we had the short rib hash, soft shell crab and waffles, and the caramel custard with funnel cake. We also ordered pecan sticky buns to go. Everything was tasty. The short rib hash with the poached egg was my favorite but the waffles from the soft shell crab and waffles were the best I've had. They were light and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. I HATE a soggy waffle. These were awesome. Liz served us again and I was surprised that she remembered little details about us from our previous visit. Her service was just as wonderful today. Many servers can be great on occasion, but few are consistently good at their job. Liz is one of the few. Great job. If I am ever in D.C. again, I will be back. Show less\n",

When I asked about steak size was told 3-4 oz. when it arrived it looked more like 7-9 oz. Steak preparation and taste was excellent. The salad was good but basically lettuce leaves with onions and sesame seeds sprinkled on it and tossed in dressing. The fries were rectangle blocks. Tasted good but the portion could have served 6 people.

We drove over from North Carolina and unfortunately due to traffic we didn't get a chance to get to our hotel and change before going there. We were under dressed but no one made us feel bad about that, we told them we felt bad about it, but they said they didn't have a dress code. The food was very good. We had the bone marrow as an appetizer and it was very rich and the portion was larger than we expected, but it was very good. We had the scallops and short ribs for dinner and they were wonderful. We had the apple pie for dessert because that is one of the things they are known for. It was a great pie, I just prefer my apple pie a bit more gooey. This pie wasn't gooey, but still very good. We did have left overs because it was a big pie. This place is pricey, which we expected but we think it was worth it for the food that we had. We did have wine as well, so with appetizers, alcohol and dessert, we expected it. One other thing to note, if you aren't familiar with the area and don't have time to drive around to find a parking spot, on the street, bring extra money (cash) for the valet parking.

I love the open kitchen when you first walk into the restaurant. You'd think this might make the restaurant noisy and yet it's not even remotely disruptive to your dining experience. The decor isn't anything over the top, sleek and modern with rustic touches here and there, but everything feels special. The staff have been fantastic every time we've gone, very knowledgeable, helpful, and attentive. As for the food, the best way to do it is share everything. We ordered 2 mains and 3 sides and were very happy. The duck is absolutely to die for, their grits are out of this world, and their veggie sides are always a pleasant surprise. The only thing I've ever been disappointed in at Blue Duck is the dessert. They have a fresh baked apple pie which should be amazing, but it's just not. I found it to be very dry and not terribly flavorful. The ice cream that we got with it, however, was incredible. I've had other desserts here that were better, but none of them have blown me away. Now that they have a Michelin star you have to make reservations long in advance, but it's worth the wait!Show less\n",

      "This is my second review of Blue Duck - and it may even be better than the last time, which was a 20 person birthday party (mine) in Chef's Table room. This review was a dinner for four in the main dining area - with two New York foodies whose last shared meal with us was at Blue Hill at Stone Farms, one f the finest restaurants in the country so we were a bit nervous recommending any restaurant. They loved. Two of us the carrot salad - it it not what you think - whole, small carrots and mixed greens. I had the snap pea salad, in the vegetable section of the menu, snap peas, a touch of pancetta, a touch of eggplant, I thought I spied some mint, fabulous. The fourth salad was their equivalent of house greens, a big thumbs us.Dinner was special I had, as always, the duck breast. Perfectly prepared. One guest had the braised short ribs, a signature dish, the best in the city except when Bobby Van's is offering them. My wife asked Ahmal - a total pro, did the birthday party - \"what happened to the crab bakes\" and he said no worries, not on the menu but we will make them for you. They did - and my Baltimore raised wife thought, as always, they were terrific. The fourth guest had the organic chicken, loved it, was large enough she could not finish it her husband did. Sides? Mushrooms - a ten out of ten. Asparagus - ditto. A kind of French Fry which is really a rectangular block of mashed potatoes quick fried - twelve out of ten.We forced ourselves to order the apple pie for two for the four us. It arrived with a glass bucket - did you say bucket - of vanilla ice cream and strawberry sorbet I had ordered and canceled when the table agreed on the apple pie When I reminded Ahmal of this the said it, and the entire dessert and coffee (COMPASS, local roaster, very good coffee), were on the house. The apple pie is medium size pie that almost looks like a an apple tort, steaming hot inside, perfect apples perfect pastry shell. One last note - the servers, the wait staff at Blue Duck are professionals, not college students or actors. It makes a tremendous difference. I would tell you what this all cost but our sneaky out of town guests slipped Ahmal their credit card mid-meal without our noticing it.If I could give more than five stars, I would.Show less\n",

      "Blue Duck Tavern is the restaurant within the lobby of the Hyatt. It has great design -- lots of fancy Moser furniture. We ate here twice on our most recent visit to DC. Breakfast was great -- the french toast and waffles were popular in our group. Sandwiches for lunch were nice, but not terrific (the accompanying fries were undercooked and soggy). The food is great for hotel food -- much tastier than most restaurants in fancy hotels. One underwhelming aspect was the service. The service was slow / absent even though the restaurant was not busy -- perhaps very understaffed. For example, our food came and the waiters disappeared until the check came -- never came by to see if we needed anything else.Show less\n",

We were seated right away and we had a very attentive maitre d that brought us a drink list and explain some of the menu components. We ordered cocktails right away and they were delicious. This was a few months ago and I don't remember exactly which ones they were but I do remember that they were really good. The highlights of our trip and what we were really looking forward to was the bone marrow appetizer. This was our first time trying it and it did not disappoint. It was very fatty but it had these wonderfully roasted garlic cloves with it and spread on butter it was to die for. I honestly don't even remember what we had for dinner except that we were not disappointed with any part of the meal.Show less\n",

Never underestimate a customer.If you like a snarky waitress who gives you minimal attention to questions about the menu, appears irratted that you didn't know what cocktail to drink at the moment she came to the table, takes your bread off plate away from you TWO times before you are finished eating your bread, brings out asparagus that is way over cooked, hush puppies that appeared to have been sitting out too long that they were dry and sea scallops that had too many conflicting spices with garlic that was SO potent it ruined the taste, you loved being rushed through dinner when the place is less than full ....Do you think we would subject ourselves to the offer of dessert ?If you are one that doesn't mind the service described and food less than par, then this is the place for you !Show less\n",

We sat down and we're presented menus with Happy Birthday printed on them which was a lovely touch. The waiter was charming and recommended a fantastic wine to go with the duck we had chosen. The duck was to die for, with a blueberry mostarda that I still dream about having again months later. We ordered a desert to share which was rich and chocolatey-everything I could've asked for.The only thing I didn't like was the chilli broccoli but the whole experience was fantastic so it didn't really make a difference to me.

      "BDT was recently awarded a Michelin Star but this is a 10 star restaurant for any foodie. We have eaten here 4 or 5 times and each visit is deeply satisfying. Our recent outing began with a salad of romaine lettuce, radish, sunflower seeds and red onion with Green Goddess dressing. A perfect salad with a dressing that accented but didn't overpower. A white bean puréed soup with cumin tasted both lighter than you might imagine but had a welcome punch of cumin that demanded that bread clean the bowl. And raw baby scallops set off by potato latkes revealed briny sweetness. I love ordering steak in non-steakhouses because great restaurants make it a dish. BDT served a 8 ounce, sliced ribeye, that ate more like a very rich sirloin in a delicious wine-infused reduction and the roast chicken of well seasoned crispy skinned dreams. Both dishes paired perfectly with broiled Brussels sprouts and what BDT calls fries (which seem to be mashed potatoes pressed into bars and lightly fried off--wow). Desserts follow suit and trust me the whole Apple pie for 2 can satisfy 4 (if your doubtful then order some ice cream as well). BDT may be seeking more stars, but pure deliciousness is a higher standard and the restaurant is nirvana on that score. Show less\n",

I had duck, which is my favorite meat, but it did not impress so much, a bit on the dry side, and not in a particularly interesting combination. None of the dishes were especially memorable even though the ‘legendary’ apple pie is quite good. I am maybe a bit biased because the restaurant parked me in the bar denying that my party had arrived and let me sit there for 20 minutes without service, and not even allowing me to check into the restaurant myself. Only when my friends finally texted me from inside were they convinced. I was very well dressed and behaved too so that cannot have been the issue, more like untrained staff. Our table waiter was OK, nothing more, and the white wine not chilled at first. I do not expect to go here again with all the other excellent places to be tempted by in DC now. Show less\n",

We then had a table near the corner for dinner. We had the scallop appetiser, don't let the fact it is raw scare you off, it is great. The dishes are all very large, so order and share accordingly. Great corn bread and bread baskets. The pork chops and braised beef were fantastic. The Potato rafters (a cross between very large french fries and potato tots) are unique and a good choice for a side. The apple pie ala mode for dessert is worth leaving room for. It is a thick pie for two (or more) people.The not so good: A restaurant this good should have white and black napkins depending on what patrons are wearing.

Friends and family gave it rave reviews and it has ranked high on the Washingtonian Magazine Top 100 list for at least the past two years (#17 in 2016, #28 on the recently released 2017 rankings), so we were enthusiastic to try it. We lucked into a street parking slot in front of the hotel, but there is valet service available and I believe they validate the parking (based on our waiter asking us that question at the end of our dinner). Inside the hotel lobby, it is rather hard to tell where the restaurant actually starts as it seems to kind of blend in with another area of tables (a coffee shop area I believe). We could not actually find a sign for the restaurant inside the hotel. Anyway, one can obviously eventually figure out where to go. It is right off of the main lobby on the ground floor with a view through massive tall glass windows out onto the road. The decor is very modern. The food quality was excellent as you would hope for given its high ranking. The bread service was excellent. The butternut squash soup was particularly good. A cauliflower salad was well prepared, not my favorite flavor combinations quite honestly, but well done. The duck breast entree was very good. My wife had a mushroom pasta special dish from the small plate section of the menu (as her entree) that was a little dry (expected a more creamy base), but overall good as well. Although selected from the smaller portion section of the menu, it was nevertheless quite filling. All of the portion sizes were quite generous. We skipped dessert as we ran out of room.

Adrienne, our server, was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave us excellent recommendations including Chef Brad's whole roast duck. This is not an item currently on the menu and the night that we were there he only had 7 ducks, and we were fortunate enough to claim the last one. I love duck, and this might just be the best duck that I've ever had. If you have a dining party big enough I highly recommend this option if it is available.Show less\n",

      "My relatives and I are from D.C. and NYC, and recently dined at Blue Duck for dinner to see if it was up to the one star awarded to the restaurant by the Michelin Guide. While I would love to tell you the restaurant was worthy of the accolade, unfortunately the meal fell short. While our server was very pleasant and tried her best to ensure we had a good experience, her descriptions of the menu items were lifeless and lacked any of the excitement, knowledge of ingredients, and general passion that distinguish restaurants run by Washington's best chefs. While she put on a smile, she clearly was just going through the motions. Other service glitches included leaving me without a napkin for the entire dessert course and bringing a new bottle of sparkling water when our glasses were full and we were nearing the dessert course. At a Michelin-starred restaurant, the service details matter, and here they were lacking. As for the food, certain dishes were delicious -- the pear salad, duck breast, and apple pie a la mode come to mind. Other dishes -- while long on style and presentation -- simply lacked flavor. The lobster entrée, for example, was heavy and overdone, creating a dish that lacked any of the ocean, lemon-buttery flavor that should be found in any lobster cooked from the coast of Maine (trust me, I'm from New England, and have eaten lobster my entire life). Overall, while there were some definite high notes to the meal, the service and food lacked the panache and execution that should be expected of a Michelin 1 star. In general, Blue Duck infuses its cooking with a heavy, rich, almost-French personality that simply is out of step with the chic, airy, and sophisticated surroundings. For my money, there are several better choices in the city (Komi, Tosca, Centrolina, Kapnos, Fiola Mare, and several others). My relatives from NYC -- who dine out 3-4 times per week at NYC's best, from Le Bernadin to Masa -- agreed. Blue Duck may earn plaudits from DC food critics and the Michelin guide, but trust me when I tell you that it does not hold up against several other kitchens in DC, let alone against the best of NY, SF, London, Paris, or other food capitals of the world. It's too bad because we wanted to love it. Instead, we came away feeling very full, but somehow unsatisfied.Show less\n",

But I found it a little underwhelming. I was there for brunch and I had the brussel sprouts with a side of bacon and a bagel and I found it pretty underwhelming. Good, to be sure, but not amazing and not necessarily worth the price. I did think that the pastry plate appetizer was good though. I will probably give it a second chance.Show less\n",

      "This very popular restaurant looks nice, but not extraordinary. In fact, we commented that in appearance it reminded us of a \"typical\" nice hotel restaurant. Appearances can be deceiving! We are in DC for a quick visit with our adult children, and our daughter made dinner reservations for five of us. Wow! The celery soup, poached pear salad, and cauliflower salad were extraordinary starters, but the best was what came after! The duck with cranberry compote was the best duck I have EVER had, and I am an enthusiastic duck fan. The braised short ribs and pork also received accolades. The most fun part of the meal was choosing among the unusual side dishes. The sweet and sour turnips were colorful and tart. The crispy Brussels sprouts with a subtle tomato sauce alongside were gone in an instant, as were the mashed sweet potatoes, and cheese topped wild mushrooms. The cornbread in cast iron with whipped honey butter was not a hit; it was a bit too sweet and cake like for the southerners in our group. The service was absolutely perfect. Friendly, but not the least bit intrusive. The drink and wine menu was impressive. The dessert selections looked heavenly - especially the apple pie with cheddar cheese that would have served three or even four - but, having utterly failed to restrain ourselves at dinner itself, we just couldn't! I'm now regretting passing on the key lime ganache! With two drinks apiece, starters, entrees, and five shared sides, the bill came to about eighty dollars per person plus tip. We truly enjoyed our evening and highly recommend giving this gem a try!Show less\n",

Oysters as appetizer were small (size 4 I estimate), but you get 6 so a good portion. I had a glass of Sancerre white whine which was way too cold. Near freezing. I do not understand they do not have a decent cooling for white whine in such a place to have it at 10-11 degrees centigrade. After freezing my hands off warming the whine it was quite elegant and a great combination with the Oysters. My main was lamb. Unfortunately it came luke warm, and the apple and sauce were cold. So I received a new one, but no new side dishes (fries and Brussels sprouts), so then I had a warm piece of lamb, and cold side dishes. The fries were very different from what I expected. Long large squares of potato mash which were fried. But they were quite good, and came with a nice hot mayonaise. I had a glass of Langhe Nebbiolo red wine which was quite good (I have had better). The total bill was US$80, which I found quite reasonable given the food quality. Clearly they deducted some money for the cold lamb shank, therefore they receive the full 5 rating.Show less\n",

      "We were so excited to dine at BDT but the trouble started upon arrival. Two hostesses at the door, neither said hello or greeted us or offered to take our coats until we identified ourselves as having reservations. Took our coats and said our table was not ready even though we had a reservation and we then watched them work to set up a bunch of pushed together tables in the bar. They never told us when we made the reservation that they would be seating us in the bar instead which was not comfortable as the tables are too low . We asked to be seated in the dining room and waited another 10-12 minutes for a table to be ready in the main dining room. They should have told us at the time of reservation that they only had tables available in the bar...and that they would do their best to accommodate us in the main dining room if possible. We were a party of 7pp.We were finally seated in the dining room but no one approached the table for 5-7 minutes then what appeared to be a captain came to the table, apologized for the delay, said he would provide bread and water while we waited for our server to arrive and take our order...really, really odd. By this point in time, , more than half the dining room was empty. Another 5 minutes went by until our server arrived. She never said hello, and asked if we had looked at the menu and were ready to order drinks and food? By now almost 45 minutes had passed from our arrival to the restaurant with a reservation and we were getting cranky. Many of us ordered burgers and the server never offered us options for what type of cheese or other toppings would be available. Only asked how we wanted them cooked. Hence, mine came with blue cheese, mushrooms and onions, none of which I asked for...?

We started with the wood-over roasted bone marrow which I was a little weary of, but it was amazing and so savory. The poached pear salad was also delicious. For our entrees, the duck breast and halibut-both cooked to perfection and the flavors were all paired perfectly. My favorite dish was the smoked sweet potato mash which was to die for-such a unique flavor. We also had the escarole and beans which were good, but compared to the rest of the food, was not a star (which is ok). They also gave us complimentary hand cut fries and wild mushrooms, also both very good. There was plenty of food (too much actually) for the both of us to finish, but we ordered dessert anyways. We had their signature apple pie and homemade ice cream which were also delicious. Overall, the food was excellent and I see why this restaurant has a Michelin star.

Oh wait, the sweet potato cheesecake was also delicious but the apple pie for 2, which they are noted for, was not great. This was taken off our bill which was a very nice gesture! Let's move on to brunch/lunch! We went once this past Spring and once in the Fall of 2015. We sat outside on both occasions which was both comfortable and enjoyable. The menu was more interesting and the food was delicious! Not sure why such a difference but my husband and I both agreed. You should definitely give it a whirl but maybe when the sun is shining and you can sit outside! Show less\n",

My fiancé eyed the freshly baked apple pies as we were seated.I had a wonderful poached pear salad. It was nothing short of spectacular. Tender, ruby pears nestled in a bed of blanched kale pecans and sheep's milk cheese. The red wine poached pear liquid was so decadent, I could have licked the plate! My fiancé had the BDT burger and fries, which he enjoyed immensely. But honestly, I got the best plate. I would go back to DC just to eat at the Blue Duck for lunch!Show less\n",

      "This has been our favorite restaurant in the DC area for some years. We love the 'farm to table' emphasis and the easy, urban vibe of the place. We recently visited for dinner with friends the evening before Thanksgiving and got our favorite table in close proximity to the open kitchen. The menu has changed a bit since we last visited and we were all a bit surprised (and disappointed) to see no dishes featuring fresh truffles. Being November and knowing Blue Duck's traditional celebration of this lovely ingredient, I was eagerly looking forward to seeing how it would be featured. What was worse was that their signature BDT duck fat fries have been replaced with some kind of hash brown that has been shaped to look like the fries. I mean, really? They tasted like they might have come from a diner...The rest of the dinner was fine. The food was sophisticated comfort food and everything was satisfactory. We didn't bother with dessert and the reason was all to do with the service. Blue Duck has always had easy going, chilled out servers who were knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the food. Despite being quite full we would always try at least one dessert because they sold us on it. Not this time. Our server was professional but not warm, not friendly and not in love with the food. Shame.Show less\n",

The service is...well...HORRIBLE! It took the bartender forever to take my pre-dinner drink order and she had an attitude when she did. Nonchalant, uncaring. Never smiled. The vodka gimlet was great...fortunately. Once seated, our server was a quiet Asian woman who catered to the man at the table. She didn't enunciate well and basically whispered so we had to continually ask her to repeat herself. She also never smiled. Not sure why the staff has such sour faces all the time. It is SO unwelcoming. Also, we waited a LONG time for her to finally come back and take our order after she delivered my friends' cocktails.Show less\n",

The biggest is that my wife gets supremely annoyed when I order the same two items whenever we go to the Blue Duck. I normally order the Bone Marrow appetizer and the Apple Pie for (\"two\") dessert. I'm a glutton for apple pie and since my wife loathes apple pie then, well, you know. As for the entree, I get whatever strikes me at the moment. I like the beef short rib when available and the halibut is good too. The bar is very good in that they actually follow a cocktail recipe instead of engaging in \"creative\" improvisation.Show less\n",

We also shared the seared foie gras and the cauliflower salad. My duck breast was PERFECT, friend had amazing sweetbreads and tagliatelle pasta. My hubby had the pork chop which was okay but not as good as our other entrees. In there defense my hubby makes such an incredible pork chop at home it was hard to compare. Yummy brussel sprouts and mushrooms accompanied our meals. We ended our meal with a seasonal cheesecake, home made ice cream and sugar cookies to bring home for our 10 year old.

My having to request this on three different occasions did not embarrass the waiter. Having him pick up the bill with my credit card required great effort from my part as he was on the other side of the restaurant chatting with other waiters. The wait between the appetizers and the main dishes was interminable. The waiter mumbled something about the kitchen being backed up. The food, while plentiful was unimaginative and salty.

      "WOW, what a great meal! The restaurant has been open ten years, winning at least one local award each year; in the last year it has won a (well-deserved) Michelin star. Located on the ground floor of the Hyatt Place hotel, the restaurant has a sophisticated décor and ambience. As my wife and I both cook, we particularly appreciate recipes with carefully chosen ingredients and preparations which exhibit the various flavors of those ingredients. Blue Duck gets very high marks in this regard. Every dish was terrific, but two stood out. The cauliflower salad showed great expertise, exhibiting different textures as well as carefully chosen flavors. The cauliflower had been roasted to soften its texture, but crunch was returned to the salad with pomegranate seeds. We couldn’t identify the spice sprinkled over the salad, so asked the server, who summoned the chef. Turns out the spice was sumac, gathered for the restaurant by a licensed herbalist in New Jersey. Tremendous care in selecting ingredients. The other standout was the smoked duck, which we chose based on other TripAdvisor reviews. We agreed, the best duck we have ever had, which is saying quite a bit because I often choose duck on the first visit to a restaurant to understand the kitchen’s abilities. Here, the duck was lightly and delightfully smoked and then cooked rare, leaving it moist, tender, and absolutely delicious.A meal like this is not inexpensive, but at Blue Duck it’s worth every penny.

Some of the best beef and fowl dishes in town, not to mention lighter fare including the best Reuben sandwiches outside of New York. I've never had a dish that misfired, and we go every couple of months.But the very best dish on the menu is the apple pie for two. Light flakey crust; a mix of sweet and tart apples that gets the sweet and tart balance exactly right. The menu says \"for two\", but really the portion is enough for three if the table wants to share. Come to think of it, all of the BDT's dishes are very generous portions. The rest of the desserts are excellent; someday I'll m going to is it for a three course lunch. All desserts!The waitstaff makes every group feel welcomed and a bit special. One of my party ordered a chicken dish and couldn't finish. So she requested the usual doggy bag.

My husband had the Cheshire pork chop which he raved about.For sides we had the white corn grits which were fantastic. We also tried the BDT fried which were fried mashed potatoes cut into wedges. They were ok, but would not order them again. Dessert was apple pie for 2 (which could have served 4). It was also average.

      "I once lived in Washington as a student many years ago, a situation which gives one a unique perspective on any city. To pay for my many expensive habits such as wine, women and amateur dramatics I took a job as a Washington guide (yes I had a badge too) and spent 8 very interesting and enjoyable months mixing my scholastic life of learning with my guiding source of income as light relief and a way of considerably widening my social circle. I was astounded at the number of people, most of whom were American who wanted to know more about their capital city. In the course of that time I naturally ate quite a lot of food I did not cook myself on a more or less 24/7 basis. You learn a lot about restaurants when you stand between them and their presumptive clientele. One thing I learned was the very odd nature of Brunch in DC. There are a lot more upmarket hotels in Washington now than there where then. Everything from the craziness of interstellar cuisine such as Minibar to some very pedestrian places we will not be discussing. But on Sunday everything seems to shift gear just ever so slightly.Washington is a city of politicians but diplomats too, and their consular and ambassadorial staff. Of course politicians tend to disappear at the weekends except in times of national catastrophe, such as the present election. But normally Washington at the weekend is home to relaxing foreigners and avid tourists. Not forgetting a fair number of students from the high echelon end of the local universities out to show themselves just how sophisticated they are. The result is odd. Restaurants serving normal set meals dive into a completely American conception of Brunch. A sort of boozy breakfast with no hold bars. I am no stranger to the whole thing but oddly enough my favourite place for brunch is the Hyde Park Hilton at the Top of the Tower restaurant or whatever it is called. You will not have a more zany experience in your life. Not so in Washington. Here it is all much tribal. \"Oh no we never go south of M for brunch.\", \"they always choose those tacky little places down by the river.\". And if you reserve for Brunch (and you have to reserve at anywhere creditable) then you must be prepared for some new experiences. Entering the Blue Duck is a bit odd because you have to find the door which is not self-evident. I mean, it is that upmarket. But not really discrete, because this is a big floor area with open kitchens (you practically walk through them) around the prep area before the plates are trays are carried out. It is all very, very pretentious. More like visiting a large department store with no counters, just tables. Why it was necessary to use the \"Tavern\" in the name escapes me. Perhaps they thought the magical reference to treasured ideas of merry dining in a rustic atmosphere would strike a chord? I think not. Modern, Scandinavian with a slight hint of something like Indian modern (think Delhi HIlton). My first reaction was to try and persuade my host that perhaps a walk back to the Hotel over the road would be better, or even to try and join the queue for free breakfast (the restaurant provides this service for a nearby hotel). But we were there, food is not life, does it really matter etc. So we settled for an outside table to avoid the monotonous drone of the regulars to relax in the open air. Washington can be perfect at this time of year and the brisk walk had generated an appetite. Our server, helper, table assistant whatever they call themselves at this place introduced herself which was nice, but unnecessary and obviously was confused. We did not look or sound like tourists but we were not with the rest of the tribes inside. So there was deference and some caution as the menu was inspected and the first surprise appeared. There was no Lunch. There was Brunch - a fairly short and uninspiring menu - and that was it. The kitchen would be open for dinner but nothing in the a la carte was available until then. Then it became clear to me what was going on. The Blue Duck is American. The menu was quite simply trying to accommodate some American tastes in a mostly it catered to dishes that were a little unusual but less important as food than tribal trophies. \"have you tried the ribs at Blue Duck etc\". That is not a Brunch.A Brunch is a groaning buffet of breakfast delights usually with something more substantial available, a carvery for example. And champagne included either mixed or by itself. So with the limited menu and the small servings of slightly warmed food we thankfully spent the entire time talking in the fresh air. The members of the tribes had homes to go to and we saw several exoduses during the time we were there. I would like to visit the Blue Duck again, but not for Brunch, not unless they have a real brunch, whatever the elders in the tribe think.Show less\n",

      "I had a leisurely lunch here yesterday. The food reminds me of an improved and modernized version of Blue Ribbon Brasserie in Soho. The marrow bone was the best I have ever had, topped with muted but flavorful Asian inspired crust offsetting the creamy buttery texture of the marrow. Crab cakes were pure crab, through and through, just spiced enough to highlight the backfin’s sweetness without overwhelming it. Vegetables (crispy Brussels sprouts and savory mushrooms) and the wine (a lovely Pinot and perfectly balanced Malbec) were selected by our waitress Leena. A good restaurant provides tasty food crafted from top-shelf ingredients. A great eatery is more than its food, it is also about its servers as our waitress, Leena demonstrated. Not only was she able to inform our table about the ingredients and preparation of every item on the menu, but she helped combine the dishes to build a seamless dining experience.

The service was on point and our waiter was great. After we were seated, we would welcome with glasses of champagne for our anniversary. Always make a note of a celebration when making a reservation ; ). We had the rib-eye for two, the white corn grits and a cucumber salad. The steak was delicious and so tender. The grits were the perfect accompaniment. My only, and I wouldn't call it a complaint, more of a preference. The cucumbers in the salad were cut into large chunks. I felt that they should have been much thinner which would have enabled them to soak up more of the dressing. The meal was well paced and we never felt rushed. For dessert we had Key Lime pie and the cookie plate. My husband, who is not that impressed with most dining experiences, LOVED the Blue Duck.

We were pointed towards another area...we were told that area wasn't open though others were sitting there. The person told us to go to the bar area. We finally got a seat and a waitress. My friend had the $20 Reuben, we thought it would be really good for that price...never assume! It was the worst Reuben we ever encountered. The meat was the consistency of jerky, I think they forgot the cheese and 1000 island plus it was rock hard! I had a single crab cake which was served on a bed of canned corn, cake was the smallest I've ever seen but tasted okay.

Ambiance aside, service was excellent and knowing that they only use high quality, locally sourced ingredients also added to our experience. Highly recommended dishes:Lobster Salad - Lobster was so fresh and the dressing they used on this was superb. Duck with Blueberry - Served with a duck thigh and neatly sliced perfect medium rare duck breast. It was THE best entree of the trip for our carnivore. Fried green tomatoes - Perfectly fried and flavorful. Really enjoyed these and I've a newfound appreciation for green tomatoes after I tried this. We also tried the Green Gazpacho soup special and the crab cakes. The soup was slightly smoky from the roasted bacon bits and the crab cakes were made well with 100% crab meat and zero breading. Both were pretty good but I may opt to try some other options on a revisit. Overall, a fantastic all around restaurant and an exceptional dining option if you're in the area.Show less\n",

I had read about it on TA and it seemed interesting. We wanted to get a table outside and even though it was not raining were told that this would be impossible due to the weather so we settled for a nice two top by the windows. We ordered for the crab CAKES and when they finally came were disappointed that we only got one. I have never really been satisfied with crab cakes and this one was just the same old same old. Tasty, but too much bread and not enough crab. It came with some sort of succotash and had lima beans in it beside the corn and other stuff and I hate lima beans!!! We decided not to have any wine as even by DC standards it was grossly overpriced and I do know my wine. It is not that we could not afford the wine but we refused to be ripped off so we settled for water. When it came it was Perrier which we can drink but we had ordered just plain old DC tap water, NO ICE PLEASE our teeth are sensitive, and we had to reject it due to the ice but finally got what we wanted but it took a while. The serving staff was lackadaisical at best, not very attentive. When our crab \"cakes\" arrived, it was only one as I have said and at that point our waitron was informed that they could bring the bill as we would like to just eat and pay and get out. Eventually I had to go in search of our waitron to remind her that we would like to get \"the damn check\". We almost considered walking out without paying just to see what would happen, but decided discretion was the better part of valor.

It was very good.Belgian Waffle with Creme Brulee, Roasted Peach - This was outstanding and I highly recommend you order this. There is not a whole lot of a description that I can provide beyond the ingredients other than to say it was delicious. BDT Brunch Burger - This had an egg, red onion, pickles, and garlic aioli. It was also delicious and I'm not even a huge burger fan. The food was truly outstanding. The layout of the place is very nice and not packed together like a lot of DC restaurants. The reason I have to take the rating down a full point is that the service was awful. Our server disappeared routinely and on multiple occasions we had to locate her for more water. Additionally, it took 45 minutes for our food to come out and over an hour for our entire meal.

      "My fiancé and I just finished dinner at Blue Duck Tavern and left with the biggest smiles on our face. First I must give credit where credit is due - our server Adrienne made our evening. She explained the menu in such a way as to name favorites and give recommendations without us feeling forced into a certain dish. I loved this about her. She gave her opinion but then described the flavors of each dish so it was easy to pick what we liked - we had never seen someone talk about so many different dishes and flavors in such a way that made us excited and she didn't disappoint - we easily found several dishes to suit what we liked. We started with the Redfish Crudo - a sashimi style dish with a mix of salty, sweet and spicy flavors. Everything Adrienne described was exactly as it tasted. Then we moved on to the Bone Marrow. Neither of us had experienced Bone Marrow but it had come home highly recommended from friends. We had told Adrienne we were unfamiliar and she walked us through all the tastes of Bone Marrow and how it would come served. It was fantastic! Then we moved on to the speciality dish of The Whole Duck. Wow, just wow. Chef Brad does not disappoint - my fiancés mom is a professional chef and I'm an event planner who has worked on 6 continents - we both had never tasted duck prepared as well as this. Hats off to Chef Brad - we were blown away. We finished the evening with homemade ice cream and the chocolate speciality and once again we were impressed. I must say we had heard positive things about Blue Duck Tavern but didn't expect to be so impressed by every course - We were; we really were. Most fine dining restaurants are relatively consistent but I think credit is due as when I head back I will request Adrienne as my waitress and hope Chef Brad is there to cook up something special.

      "This is a great restaurant...quiet, dignified, quite wonderful. I want to leave a general comment for almost all restaurants who understandably also call to confirm a reservation in open table. Blue Duck is no exception. Here is a point I hope Blue Duck and all restaurants will understand. One: Important clients do not answer their phones -- increasingly we do everything by text/email, etc? Maybe I get three max calls a day -- so a phone interruption is really annoying ... Secondly, the reservation client always leaves a different number than is the receiving number on the mobile phone. Therefore, it is necessary to listen to the message...write down the number and call again. And then call..Much easier is just to hit the phone caller button and boom, right back to the restaurant...So my suggestion to all restaurants is to let us return the call to the line that the call was placed. I know it is important to confirm -- no problem there...and we all all grateful to services such as OpenTable (and Uber) -- both of which are life changers..please accept my comment not as criticism, but as helpful suggestion. I will, of course, post a comment about the latest visit to Blue Duck -- but I know it will be great :)Show less\n",

So of course this made the steak stone cold and not very appetizing- we looked around for our waiter but it was like he had disappeared into thin air!! When he did eventually appear we told him we were not happy (bearing in mind this was a special occasion) we were offered a free dessert *sigh* now on to the dessert - this was inedible! We had Peach Melba and for some reason the peach was encased in an inedible sponge or coating of some sort and the ice cream was so small it was practically invisible.

      "My husband and I had brunch at Blue Duck Tavern during a long weekend in DC. We stayed in Dupont, but I read rave reviews about Blue Duck so I made reservations in advance before our trip. Having been, I don’t think that was necessary as there were plenty of tables for breakfast on a Friday morning! The restaurant is beautiful, open and welcoming. For our meal, I had the Jumbo Lump Crab with Scrambled Egg Whites, Tomato, baby Spinach and Avocado (they removed the cream cheese per my request – it was light, fluffy and delicious) and my husband had the Short Rib Hash (a dish he gets almost everywhere it is available but proclaimed this was one of the best!). We shared the BDT Fries which were served stacked like jenga bricks – crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and super savory! I had tea, he had coffee. Our total was just under $100, which was definitely expensive (especially for breakfast) but that is expected from the Park Hyatt. The only other negative was that our food took awhile, but as we were on vacation and not in a rush that was alright. Overall, the meal was delicious and definitely a fun vacation treat!Show less\n",

Very ordinary. The oysters were great ---but not the rest. Generally, lacked interesting flavor -- bone marrow used to be great, but now little marrow and lots of mustard ; crab cakes used to be delicious but now dry ( a sauce may have helped ?!) ; and other things - meats and fish basically rare while nothing else interesting about their prep.

The Hostess was very nice. We didn't have a reservation but she suggested we sit in the bar area since they had full meal service there. That was fine with us. Our initial server, Claudia, was excellent and very attentive! They had a very nice wine list so that was definitely a plus. We started with a cheese and charcuterie plate that had some good selections on it. For dinner, I ordered the duck breast and the fried green tomatoes. My husband ordered the prime steak, hand cut fries, and eggplant. Each is served in a separate dish so it made sharing easy. HOWEVER....nothing was really hot except for the fries. And I ordered my duck breast medium rare and it came out more like well done. Considering what we paid, it was disappointing.So back to our server. As I said, we originally had Claudia. The servers swapped around some and we ended up with Kenny. I think we saw Kenny maybe once after he became our primary server. We ended up waving at Claudia to get her attention so we could get our check. We spoke to the manager, Brandon, about our experience. He was very nice and apologetic. Show less\n",

This place wasn't cheap but i would order them again in a heartbeat, seemed so simple yet awesome. scallops were also very good, cooked to perfection.Now this is why i give it a 5 star, Our steak came out and we ordered it rare, however it came out medium well before we even took a bite. I understand mistakes happen and upon notifying our server, he made no fuss, whipped it away and i assumed he was to bring another when ready, i understood it might take a while as it is a large piece of meat. however what our server did was outstanding, he went above and beyond. we made no fuss and were waiting patiently when out comes a lobster salad on the house. I'm not normally a lobster person as it is nearly always overcooked however this one was delicious and I'm glad i got to try it. then out came a complimentary round of drinks for all 3 of us on the table, not just the 2 of us who had the steak overcooked. we had been ordering the blueberry cocktail which was awesome! I think our server was called alex but i could not remember.Then out came the steak, slightly under rare but good enough for me, the fact they went out of their way to make sure we were happy more than enough made up for it and i left there very happy and they fully deserve their 5 star rating.

      "After a movie at a nearby theater, my wife and I stopped in at this West End standard in the Park Hyatt and rediscovered why it has always been one of our favorites. This is not, despite its location, a mere \"hotel restaurant\" but a wonderful fine dining venue that stands very much on its own legs. The decor is a beautiful mix of modern and rustic vocabularies with a beautifully appointed bar and a central wood burning oven that is the heart of the kitchen and, if you choose to sit near, of your dining experience. There is also wonderful outdoor seating.The food is great farm-to-table fare with a few Southern accents like friend green tomatoes and exquisite white corn grits likely gleaned from Chef Brad Deboy's earlier experience at another fine dining standard, Vidalia. For starters, you can choose from items as varied as a summer salad with locally grown peaches, savory squid ink cavatelli with a hefty helping of fresh clams or, for the extreme gourmand, a helping of wood oven roasted bone marrow. Whatever direction you go in, you will enjoy the trip. Whether you opt for meat, poultry or fish/shellfish for your main course, the taste and presentation of each amply filled plate will be excellent. For me, the roasted quail and the crabcakes are the usual alternative choices but I've strayed from them before and was never disappointed. They are justly famous here for their fries but the aforementioned grits stand just as tall in my mind. The desserts, particularly the apple pie for two in the event you have a willing partner, are all great. And I must note, though this is justly considered a fine dining restaurant, the portions are not small so either be prudent in ordering or choose knowing that you'll be taking some home. The wine list is very good in quality and breadth. While we had a post theater dinner, the place is great for a business lunch or a weekend brunch, as well. While children would certainly be welcome and there are good seating choices for a family, the quality of the place is probably best enjoyed among a group of adult friends or professionals or, certainly, a couple out for a romantic experience. There are both loud, convivial areas and quieter ones more conducive to soft conversation. Consult the excellent staff with your needs on this point.So, for a comfortable but somewhat luxurious farm-to-table experience, loosen the purse strings and give this place a try. You'll have the best of home and the best of a great meal out at the same table.Show less\n",

      "We visited Washington DC for a business trip recently and dined at the Blue Duck Tavern for a weekend dinner. We were seated promptly at one of the tables with the long bench seating. Our attentive waiter proceeded to take our drink orders and brought out the dinner bread. The wine selection is extensive both by the glass and the bottle. Our attendant opened a new bottle of Merlot in order for me to have a taste. For appetizer, I ordered the chilled red pepper soup from the specials, and it was outstanding. The presentation was table side with the soup poured from a metal kettle into a garnished china bowl. The soup contained red peppers, corn, creme fraiche, and fennel. It tasted similar to gazpacho, and it had a bit of a kick. For my entree, I ordered the organic chicken with fermented onion vinaigrette. It was served as an ample portion with three pieces including, leg, breast, and thigh. The side dishes are meant to be shared. We had the potato puree along with the charred broccoli. For dessert, we selected the macaroon cheesecake. It was another outstanding special. The meringue sandwich was perfectly balanced with the raspberry and cream filling and the mascarpone cheese. It is the perfect size for two people to share, and very filling. The coffee was delicious, and it was made exactly as I requested with soy milk instead of real milk. The restaurant atmosphere with the open kitchen is nice, and to access the restrooms you have to walk through the kitchen. The only reason I did not rate Blue Duck a five star is due to the noise level being a bit high.Show less\n",

      "Where do I start? Reservation: We were offered by FHR to book at St Regis but we really wanted to have dinner with a visiting family at Blue Duck Tavern, so we decided to stay at Park Hyatt instead for convenience. This is our 2nd visit and it was good as we remembered. We were running late and called that we would be late and the hostesses thanked us for letting them know in advance which was so nice.Ambience: The restaurant lay out can be a little bit confusing but otherwise, makes it kind of unique. Lighting was excellent. Had the glass booth the last time and it was very nice and private. I like the little stool they provide for your purse. Food: It changes by seasons but you have to try the bone marrow with the roasted garlic, perfection! I base how good a restaurant is by the way they make their roasted chicken and this one is up there in my rating. Now, the brunch, I love my mimosas, but this place just make it better with the sorbet. Biscuits and gravy, to die for and the sticky buns with pecans, heavenly. Service: For dinner, we were lucky to be taken cared of by Shankar and Dip. My husband liked his wine at certain temperature and Shankar made sure he had a fresh glass everytime. He sure listens to your preference. We also had problem with one of the dishes and he was kind enough to change it. Dip was our server the last time we were there and he remembered us and even our choice of wine. For breakfast, we had Michael who was also our server before. He is \"customer service personified\". He knows the food he is serving and always has time to chat. If you happen to be at the BDT for breakfast/brunch, please ask for Michael. You won't regret it.Show less\n",

      "Got checked into the hotel right before 9p and was ready to eat dinner ! I had read multiple reviews about the Blue Duck Tavern and one from a gluten free site. They were very positive so I was looking forward to it. Let's just say they no longer have gf fries. They use the oil to fry the oysters??? Really. This pricey restaurant can't afford cooking oil to keep separate for gluten free fries ? First disappointment. Then they rotated shrimp and grits off the menu last week. The menu is one of those that sounds like the chef is trying to make unusual dishes for wow effect. The lobster salad had no more than 2 tbsp of lobster meat but lots of corn. The dressing for it was good however. Maybe $24 is a bargain for something that was about a cup of mostly flavored corn. I imagine I will try this restaurant again before I leave but unless you get an update, I'll leave it right here. Show less\n",

Our hotel concierge called around 3:30pm and got us a table when they open at 5:30pm since we had a performance to attend at 7pm. Strangely, not even half the tables were full when we left at 6:30pm. So call directly. Outdoor seating available but wasn't in use (wet). Two walls of windows as well. We were seated in the inner area where we could watch the chefs prepare the cuisine. Wait staff is all male. Ours was polite. Saratoga still or bubbly water bottles offered. Menu is a la carte. Similar to family style--they bring each diner an empty plate and sides are generous portions (plenty for two+ people). All our dishes were excellent! Prime steak, lobster salad, grits, collard greens, and hand-cut fries. Four slices of delicious rustic farmer bread and salted butter provided. Fossil point pinot noir was superb. Generous pour, but should be for $13. We never saw the dessert menu--had to rush off. Highly recommend and look forward to returning. Show less\n",

      "Because it is Washington D.C. which seems to be a foodie's nightmare due to lack of restaurant options and variety I am giving this place 3 stars. If it were in any other city I would give it 2. Overall, we were very disappointed in the food and service in D.C. For a major city we were shocked by the lack of restaurants in general. We were in town to celebrate my husbands birthday and after doing extensive research and not really finding any restaurants that really stood out to me I settled on this one. They made a special menu for my husband for his birthday which I thought was a nice touch. Our server was good which is something rare to find in D.C. I found the menu to be limited and I wish they had more options especially in terms of appetizers. We both ordered the steak entree and got the fries and cornbread as the sides. My steak came out at room temperature and I had to ask them to heat it up. They fixed it right away but this is not something that should happen at a fine dining establishment. I found the sauce that came with the steak to be overly salty. The fries which are more like a hash brown were delicious and probably my favorite thing. We did not care for the corn bread as it was overly greasy and lacked flavor. For dessert we got the strawberry short cake which was pretty good.Decor is traditional meets modern and I like the open kitchen aspect so you can see everything they are doing in the kitchen. Kitchen is very clean and nice. One thing they need to improve is the seating. Chairs are wooden with zero cushion so it feels like you're sitting on a church pew.Overall, we had a good experience.

How did the co-manager know the bill was wrong? And why wouldn't he even talk to us to understand what was going on?

Then he told us about some favorites, bone marrow appetizer and Maryland crab cakes. We decided to try the bone marrow, which came out in a beautiful presentation with toast and roasted garlic on a bed of coarse salt with yummy coleslaw. It was so good and different. Then we tried the crab cakes, definitely the best I have ever had. Full of crab and hardly any filler with a corn succotash that was delicious. Bartender then sent out the quail and fried green tomatoes for us to try, on the house. They were both utterly fantastic. I wanted to lick the plate to get all of the wonderful red pepper jelly that topped the super crispy quail, but I refrained (this is a nice place afterall). The fried green tomatoes were not at all greasy and very good. I can't say enough about this place. Amazing food and fantastic service.
